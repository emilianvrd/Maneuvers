- **Overlord's Protection** Trigger: The Rakshasa would take at least 5 damage from a Spell. Effect: The rakshasa absorbs the energy into its sword. It reduced the damage it takes by 5 and deals an extra 5 damage of the same type as the absorbed spell the next time it deals damage with its longsword. \

**Speed**: 10m

#### Actions
**Longsword**: (1 action) Melee maneuver, DC 17 Dexterity Defense Roll, reach 2m. **Damage**: 1d8 + 4 Slashing\
**Wrathful Strike**: (2 actions) The Rakshasa makes a maneuver using his Longsword. On a Failure, the target is Frightened 2.
**Disguise Self** (1 action) The Rakshasa hides its true self. the rakshasa makes the himself – including the rakshasa's clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on its person – look different until 1 hour have passed or until the rakshasa uses an action to dismiss it. the rakshasa can seem up to 30cm shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. the rakshasa can’t change the rakshasar body type, so the rakshasa must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to the rakshasa.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if the rakshasa use this spell to add a hat to the rakshasa's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the rakshasar head and hair. If the rakshasa uses this spell to appear thinner than the rakshasa is, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch the rakshasa would bump into the rakshasa while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that the rakshasa is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the rakshasa's appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the rakshasa's spell save DC.
