**Items**: Kite Shield, Longsword, Scale mail\
**Challenge Rating**: 12

**HP**: 30; **Resistances**: Physical 5 (except silver), **Weaknesses**: Radiant 5\
**Reactions**:
- **Reactive Strike** 
- **Overlord's Protection** Trigger: The Rakshasa would take at least 5 damage from a Spell. Effect: The rakshasa absorbs the energy into its sword. It reduced the damage it takes by 5 and deals an extra 5 damage of the same type as the absorbed spell the next time it deals damage with its longsword. \

**Speed**: 10m

#### Actions
**Longsword**: (1 action) Melee maneuver, DC 17 Dexterity Defense Roll, reach 2m. **Damage**: 1d8 + 4 Slashing\
**Wrathful Strike**: (2 actions) The Rakshasa makes a maneuver using his Longsword. On a Failure, the target is Frightened 2.
**Disguise Self** (1 action) The Rakshasa hides its true self. the rakshasa makes the himself – including the rakshasa's clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on its person – look different until 1 hour have passed or until the rakshasa uses an action to dismiss it. the rakshasa can seem up to 30cm shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. the rakshasa can’t change the rakshasar body type, so the rakshasa must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to the rakshasa.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if the rakshasa use this spell to add a hat to the rakshasa's outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the rakshasar head and hair. If the rakshasa uses this spell to appear thinner than the rakshasa is, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch the rakshasa would bump into the rakshasa while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that the rakshasa is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the rakshasa's appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the rakshasa's spell save DC.

## Werecreatures
Werecreatures are humanoids doomed to transform into terrible beasts under the light of the full moon. Some try to resist the curse while others embrace it and eventually learn to shapeshift at will.

### Werecreature abiliities
All werecreatures gain the following abilities, some of which match an ability of the animal the werecreature transforms into. You might also need to adjust some abilities that conflict with the theme of the werecreature (such as abilities with a conflicting alignment trait).
**Senses** The werecreature gains all the senses of the animal.
**Animal Empathy** (divination, primal) A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind.
**Claws** The werecreature gains a claw Strike (an agile unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). If it had any agile attacks, the damage dealt by its claws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only non-agile attacks, its claws should deal three-quarters that damage.
Jaws The creature gains a jaws Strike (an unarmed attack that deals piercing damage) that inflicts its curse of the werecreature. If it had any non-agile attacks, the damage dealt by its jaws should be roughly the same as the damage dealt by those attacks. If it had only agile attacks, its jaws should deal one-third more damage.
**Change Shape** (1 action) (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The werecreature changes into its humanoid, hybrid, or animal shape. Each shape has a specific, persistent appearance. A true werecreature's natural form is its hybrid shape. In humanoid shape, the werecreature uses its original humanoid size, loses its jaws and claws Strikes, and gains a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the slashing damage dealt by its claw. In animal shape, its Speed and size change to that of the animal, it gains any special Strike effects of the animal that it didn't already have (such as Grab), and it loses its weapon Strikes.
**Curse of the Werecreature** (curse, necromancy, primal) This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throw Fortitude DC is the standard DC for the werecreature's new level – 1. On each full moon, the cursed creature must succeed at another Fortitude save or turn into the same kind of werecreature until dawn. The creature is under the GM's control and goes on a rampage for half the night before falling unconscious until dawn.
**Moon Frenzy** (polymorph, primal, transmutation) When a full moon appears in the night sky, the werecreature must enter hybrid form, can't Change Shape thereafter, becomes one size larger, increases its reach by 5 feet, and increases the damage of its jaws Strike (or a similar Strike) by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, the werecreature returns to humanoid form and is fatigued for 2d4 hours.
