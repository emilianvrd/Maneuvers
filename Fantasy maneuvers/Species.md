# Ancestries
Your character’s ancestry determines which people they call their own, whether it’s diverse and ambitious humans, insular but vivacious elves, traditionalist and family-focused dwarves, or any of the other folk who call Golarion home. A character’s ancestry and their experiences prior to their life as an adventurer—represented by a background—might be key parts of their identity, shape how they see the world, and help them find their place in it.

## Dwarf

*Dwarves have a well-earned reputation as a stoic and stern people, ensconced within citadels and cities carved from solid rock. While some see them as dour and humorless crafters of stone and metal, dwarves and those who have spent time among them understand their unbridled zeal for their work, caring far more about quality than quantity. To a stranger, they can seem untrusting and clannish, but to their friends and family, they are warm and caring, their halls filled with the sounds of laughter and hammers hitting anvils.*

Dwarves are slow to trust those outside their kin, but this wariness is not without reason. Dwarves have a long history of forced exile from ancestral holds and struggles against the depredations of savage foes, especially giants, goblinoids, orcs, and the horrors that dwell deep below the surface. While trust from a dwarf is hard-won, once gained it is as strong as iron.

If you want to play a character who is as hard as nails, a stubborn and unrelenting adventurer, with a mix of rugged toughness and deep wisdom—or at least dogged conviction—you should play a dwarf.

You might...

- Strive to uphold your personal honor, no matter the situation. 
- Appreciate quality craftsmanship in all forms and insist upon it for all your gear.
- Don’t waver or back down once you’ve set your mind to something.

Others probably...

- See you as stubborn, though whether they see this as an asset or a detriment changes from one person to the next.
- Assume you are an expert in matters related to stonework, mining, precious metals, and gems.
- Recognize the deep connection you have with your family, heritage, and friends.

**Physical Description**

Dwarves are short and stocky, standing about a foot shorter than most humans. They have wide, compact bodies and burly frames. Dwarves of all genders pride themselves on the length of their hair, which they often braid into intricate patterns, some of which represent specific clans. A long beard is a sign of masculinity and honor among the dwarves, and thus a clean-shaven male dwarf is considered weak, untrustworthy, or worse.

Dwarves typically reach physical adulthood around the age of 25, though their traditionalist culture places more value on completing coming of age ceremonies unique to each clan than reaching a certain age. A typical dwarf can live to around 350 years old.

**Society**

The ancient surface empire the dwarves once ruled fell long ago, overwhelmed by orc and goblinoid enemies. Today's dwarves today retain many of the qualities that propelled their people to greatness in ancient times: fierceness, gumption, and stubbornness in endeavors ranging from battle and craftsmanship to forging ties with family and friends.

While the distance between their mountain Sky Citadels can create vast cultural divides between various dwarf clans, most dwarven societies share a number of similarities. Nearly all dwarven peoples share a passion for stonework, metalwork, and gem-cutting. Most are highly skilled at architecture and mining, and many share a hatred of giants, orcs, and goblinoids.

Few dwarves are seen without their clan dagger strapped to their belt. This dagger is forged just before a dwarf's birth and bears the gemstone of their clan. A parent uses this dagger to cut the infant's umbilical cord, making it the first weapon to taste their blood.

**Alignment and Religion**

Dwarves tend to value honor and closely follow the traditions of their clans and kingdoms. They have a strong sense of friendship and justice, though they are often very particular about who they consider a friend. They work hard and play harder— especially when strong ale is involved.

The typical dwarf is lawful good or lawful neutral and prefers to worship deities of those alignments. Torag, god of dwarvenkind, is the dwarves' primary deity, though worship of Torag's family members is also common.

**Adventurers**

Dwarven adventurers tend to work as treasure hunters or sellswords. They often leave their citadels and subterranean cities in search of wealth to enrich their homeland or to reclaim long-lost dwarven treasures or lands taken by the enemies of their kin.

Typical dwarven backgrounds include acolyte, artisan, merchant, miner, and warrior. Dwarves excel at many of the martial classes, such as barbarian, fighter, monk, and ranger, but they also make excellent clerics and druids.

**Names**
Dwarves honor their children with names taken from ancestors or dwarven heroes, and it’s quite rare to invent a new name or to borrow a name from another culture for a child. When introducing themselves, dwarves tend to list their family and clan, plus any number of other familial connections and honorifics. Dwarven names usually contain hard consonants and are rarely more or fewer than two syllables.

**Sample Names**

Agna, Bodill, Dolgrin, Edrukk, Grunyar, Ingra, Kazmuk, Kotri, Lupp, Morgrym, Rogar, Rusilka, Torra, Yangrit

### Feats

**Battleforger**
*Prerequisite: Trained in crafting.* You can sharpen weapons, polish armor, and apply special techniques to temporarily gain better effects from your armaments. By spending 1 hour working on a weapon or armor, you can grant the weapon a +1 circumstance bonus to damage for 10 minutes, or the armor a special enhancment that gives the wearer 5 temporary hit points for 10 minutes. Once you have done this, you can't do it again until the next dawn.

**Dwarven lore**
You eagerly absorbed the lore of the dwarves. You become proficent in Crafting or Society. If you are already In addition, you become trained in Dwarven lore.

**Dwarven weapon familiarity**
You have trained with new variations of the traditional weapons of the dwarves. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial Dwarf weapons are simple weapons and advanced Elf weapons are martial weapons. 

The following weapons are the ones with the Dwarf trait. All dwarfs can choose to buy any of these weapons during character creation and the GM may allow other characters to do so as well, particularly if they have a strong connection with dwarves.

*Melee Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dwarven War Axe | Dwarf, Sweep, Two-Hand(d10), Versatile P | 1d6S | 2kg | 20sp | Axe | Martial |
| Titan Mauler | Dwarf,  Razing, Reach | 1d12B | 9kg | 40sp | Hammer | Advanced |

*Ranged Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Range | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dwarven Scattergun | Dwarf, Concussive, Mighty, Scatter 6m, Two-handed | 1d6P | 40m | 3kg | 60sp | Firearm | Martial |
| Boulder Breaker | Dwarf, Mighty, Razing, Two-Handed | 1d12B | 12m | 2kg | 30sp | Sling | Advanced |

*Weapon Description*
* Dwarven War Axe: This versatile dwarven axe had been used for countless generations.
* Titan Mauler: While most dismiss this enourmous hammer as unwieldy and unfit for battle, some particularly strong dwarves have taken a liking to this powerful weapon. Due to its size, Medium or smaller wielders of this weapon take a -2m penalty to their speed.
* Dwarven Scattergun: Scatterguns fire pellets that covers a large area, but more than one dward has been caught by their own arms fire when firing at close range.
* Boulder Breaker: This massive weapon resembles a handheld catapult and is often used by dwarven sappers to take down fortifications from afar.

**Mountains stoutness**
You are as tough as the biggest mountains. You gain 5 additional hit points.  When you have the dying condition, the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 9 + your dying value (instead of 10 + your dying value).
If you also have the Toughness feat, the Hit Points gained from it and this feat are cumulative, and the DC of your recovery checks is equal to 6 + your dying value.

**Rock runner**
Growing up in mountains made you adept at moving across uneven terrain. You can ignore difficult terrain caused by stones or rocks. In addition, you ignore uneven ground made of stone and suffer no penalties for standing or moving on it. You also don’t require an Acrobatics check to balance on uneven ground made of stone and earth.

**Stonecunning**
You have a knack for noticing even small inconsistencies and craftsmanship techniques in the stonework around you. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework. This bonus applies to checks to discover mechanical traps made of stone or hidden within stone. If you aren't using the Seek action or searching, the GM automatically rolls a secret check for you to notice unusual stonework anyway. This check doesn't gain the circumstance bonus, and it takes a –2 circumstance penalty instead. 

## Elves

*As an ancient people, elves have seen great change and have the perspective that can come only from watching the arc of history. After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.*

Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.

Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They’re slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There’s a physical element to this attunement, but it isn’t only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among shorter‑lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.

If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.

You Might...

- Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans, either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them. 
- Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.
- Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.

Others Probably...

- Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.
- Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts.
- Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.

**Physical Description**

While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.

Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who’s lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.

Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren’t considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they’ve experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.

**Society**

Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.

Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time. 

**Alignment and Religion**

Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.

**Adventurers**

Many elves adventure to find beauty and discover new things. Typical backgrounds for an elf include emissary, hunter, noble, scholar, or scout. Elves often become rangers or rogues, taking advantage of their dexterity, or alchemists or wizards, exploring their intellectual curiosity.

**Names**
An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf’s life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in “-el” or “-ara” that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.

**Sample Names**

Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon

**Low-light vision**
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light. 

### Feats

**Ancestral linguistics**
Over your extensive lifespan, you've studied many languages. During your daily preparations, you can recede into old memories to become fluent in one common language or one other language you have access to. You know this language until you prepare again. Since this knowledge is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option.

**Elven lore**
You've studied in traditional elven arts, learning about arcane magic and the world around you. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Arcana or Nature. If you would automatically become trained in both of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You also become trained in Elven Lore. 

**Elven weapon familiarity**
You favor bows and other elegant weapons commonly used by elves. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial Elf weapons are simple weapons and advanced Elf weapons are martial weapons. 

The following weapons are the ones with the Elf trait. All elves can choose to buy any of these weapons during character creation and the GM may allow other characters to do so as well, particularly if they have a strong connection with elves.

*Melee Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Curve Blade | Sweep, Forceful, Two-Hand(d10)| 1d6S | 1kg | 30sp | Sword | Martial |
| Double-Bladed Scimitar | Sweep, Forceful, Two-Handed, Parry | 1d10S | 3kg | 50sp | Hammer | Advanced |

*Ranged Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Range | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sylvan Bow | Backstabber, Two-Handed | 1d10P | 60m | 1kg | 40sp | Bow | Martial |
| Mithral Tree | Fatal d12 | 1d6P | 50m | 2kg | 30sp | Firearm | Advanced |

*Weapon Description*
* Curve Blade: Carefully forged from elven steel, this versatile weapon is wielded by elves for self-defense and warfare alike.
* Double-Bladed Scimitar: A weapon so difficult to master, none other than the long-lived elves has managed to do so.
* Sylvan Bow: This light wooden bow excels at ambushing from afar.
* Mithral Tree: Neither made of mithral, nor a tree, this elven weapon is attached to the forearm and fires darts with deadly accuracy.

**Elemental wrath**
You are so attuned to the land that you can call forth a bolt of energy from your surroundings. When you gain this feat, select acid, cold, electricity, or fire. You can make a special ranged attack against a target within 16m of you that deals 1d8 damage plus 2 splash damage of the chosen type. 

**Longevity**
You have accumulated a vast array of lived knowledge over the years. During your daily preparations, you can reflect upon your life experiences to gain the trained proficiency rank in one skill of your choice. This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this proficiency is temporary, you can’t use it as a prerequisite for a skill increase or a permanent character option like a feat.

**Nimble elf**
Your muscles are tightly honed. Your Speed increases by 2m. Once per day, you can move up to your speed as a Quick action.

## Gnome

*Long ago, early gnome ancestors emigrated from the First World, realm of the fey. While it’s unclear why the first gnomes wandered to Golarion, this lineage manifests in modern gnomes as bizarre reasoning, eccentricity, obsessive tendencies, and what some see as naivete. These qualities are further reflected in their physical characteristics, such as spindly limbs, brightly colored hair, and childlike and extremely expressive facial features that further reflect their otherworldly origins.*

Always hungry for new experiences, gnomes constantly wander both mentally and physically, attempting to stave off a terrible ailment that threatens all of their people. This affliction—the Bleaching—strikes gnomes who fail to dream, innovate, and take in new experiences, in the gnomes' absence of crucial magical essence from the First World. Gnomes latch onto a source of localized magic where they live, typically primal magic, as befits their fey lineage, but this isn't enough to avoid the Bleaching unless they supplement this magic with new experiences. The Bleaching slowly drains the color—literally—from gnomes, and it plunges those affected into states of deep depression that eventually claim their lives. Very few gnomes survive this scourge, becoming deeply morose and wise survivors known as bleachlings.

If you want a character with boundless enthusiasm and an alien, fey outlook on morality and life, you should play a gnome. 

You might...

- Embrace learning and hop from one area of study to another without warning. 
- Rush into action before fully taking stock of the entire situation. 
- Speak, think, and move quickly, and lose patience with those who can’t keep up.

Others probably...

- Appreciate your enthusiasm and the energy with which you approach new situations.
- Struggle to understand your motivations or adapt to your rapid changes of direction.
- See you as unpredictable, flighty, unreliable, or even reckless.

**Physical Description**

Most gnomes stand just over 3 feet in height and weigh little more than a human child. They exhibit a wide range of natural skin, hair, and eye colors. For gnomes that haven’t begun the Bleaching, nearly any hair and eye color other than white is possible, with vibrant colors most frequent, while skin tones span a slightly narrower spectrum and tend toward earthy tones and pinkish hues, though occasionally green, black, or pale blue. Gnomes’ large eyes and dense facial muscles allow them to be particularly expressive in their emotions. Gnomes typically reach physical maturity at the age of 18, though many gnomes maintain a childlike curiosity about the world even into adulthood. A gnome can theoretically live to any age if she can stave off the Bleaching indefinitely, but in practice gnomes rarely live longer than around 400 years.

**Society**

While most gnomes adopt some of the cultural practices of the region in which they live, they tend to pick and choose, adjusting their communities to fit their own fey logic. This often leads to majority gnome communities eventually consisting almost entirely of gnomes, as other people, bewildered by gnomish political decisions, choose to move elsewhere. Gnomes have little culture that they would consider entirely their own. No gnome kingdoms or nations exist on the surface of Golarion, and gnomes wouldn’t know what to do with such a state if they had one.

By necessity, few gnomes marry for life, instead allowing relationships to run their course before amicably moving on, the better to stave off the Bleaching with new experiences. Though gnome families tend to be small, many gnome communities raise children communally, with fluid family boundaries. As adults depart the settlement, unrelated adolescents sometimes tag along, creating adopted families to journey together.

**Alignment and Religion**

Though gnomes are impulsive tricksters with inscrutable motives and confusing methods, many at least attempt to make the world a better place. They are prone to fits of powerful emotion, and they are often good but rarely lawful. Gnomes most commonly worship deities that value individuality and nature.

**Adventurers**

Adventure is not so much a choice as a necessity for most gnomes. Adventuring gnomes often claim mementos, allowing them to remember and relive their most exciting stories.

Gnomes often consider the entertainer, merchant, or nomad backgrounds. In addition, the animal whisperer, barkeep, gambler, and tinker backgrounds are particularly appropriate.

Gnomes' connection to magic makes spellcasting classes particularly thematic for you, especially classes that match the tradition of your primal innate spells, such as druid or primal sorcerer, though wellspring gnomes might choose others.

**Names**
Gnome names can get quite complex and polysyllabic. They have little interest in familial names, and most children receive their names purely on a parent’s whim. Gnomes rarely concern themselves with how easy their names are to pronounce, and they often go by shorter nicknames. Some even collect and chronicle these nicknames. Among gnomes, the shorter the name, the more feminine it’s considered to be.

**Sample Names**
Abroshtor, Bastargre, Besh, Fijit, Halungalom, Krolmnite, Neji, Majet, Pai, Poshment, Queck, Trig, Zarzuket, Zatqualmie

### Feats
**Animal Accomplice**
You build a rapport with a small animal, which becomes magically bonded to you. You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.

Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.

When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears if you spend 1 hour and 10gp to resummon it.

**Fey Touched gnome**
You have a strong connection to nature. You gain the fey trait and you learn a Fighting move with the Nature trait. 

**Illusion Sense**
Seeing through illusions and creating them comes naturally to you. As a Free action, you can immediately gain the effects of a Sustain a Spell action to extend the duration of one of your active illusion spells.

**Gnome Weapon Familiarity**
You wield the creative and innovative weapons of the gnomes. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial Gnome weapons are simple weapons and advanced Gnome weapons are martial weapons. 

All gnomes can choose to buy any of these weapons during character creation and the GM may allow other characters to do so as well, particularly if they have a strong connection with gnomes.

*Weapon Description*


**Inventive Offensive**
You can jury-rig your weapons to perform in unexpected ways. As a two-action activity, you can add one of the following weapon traits to a melee weapon you wield: deadly d6, disarm, nonlethal, shove, trip, versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S. You cannot add a trait that the weapon already has. The weapon retains this trait until you a successfully hit and deal damage with the weapon. The weapon retains this trait only while you wield it, and you can have only one weapon modified in this way at any time.

**Umbral Connection**
Whether from a connection to dark or shadowy fey, from the underground deep gnomes also known as svirfneblin, or another source, you can see in complete darkness. You gain darkvision.

### Goblin
*The convoluted histories other people cling to don’t interest goblins. These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.*

Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others’ stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions’ trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.

Though goblins’ culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.

If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.

You Might...
- Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.
- Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.
- Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.

Others Probably...
- Work to ensure you don’t accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.
- Assume you can’t—or won’t—read.
- Wonder how you survive given your ancestry’s typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.

**Physical Description**
Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.

Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.

**Society**
Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.

Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as “longshanks,” won’t treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it’s been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.

**Alignment and Religion**
Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they’re rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though.

**Adventurers**
To some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.

Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.

**Names**
Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier. Since there aren’t any real traditions regarding naming in goblin culture, children often name themselves once they’re old enough to do something resembling talking.

**Sample Names**
Ak, Bokker, Frum, Guzmuk, Krobby, Loohi, Mazmord, Neeka, Omgot, Ranzak, Rickle, Tup, Wakla, Yonk, Zibini

Your ancestors have always had a connection to fire and a thicker skin, which allows you to resist burning. You gain fire resistance 5. You can also recover from being on fire more easily. Your flat check to remove persistent fire damage is DC 10 instead of DC 15, which is reduced to DC 5 if another creature uses a particularly appropriate action to help.

**Goblin Scuttle**
You take advantage of your ally’s movement to adjust your position. As a Reaction when a creature ends its movement within 2m of you, you can move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Goblin Weapon Familiarity**
Others might look upon them with disdain, but you know that the weapons of your people are as effective as they are sharp. For the purpose of determining your proficiency, martial Goblin weapons are simple weapons and advanced Goblin weapons are martial weapons. 

The following weapons are the ones with the Goblin trait. All goblins can choose to buy any of these weapons during character creation and the GM may allow other characters to do so as well, particularly if they have a strong connection to goblins.

*Melee Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Slicer | Agile, Backstabber, Finesse, Goblin| 1d6S | 1kg | 10sp | Sword | Martial |
| Horsechopper | Goblin, Reach, Two-Handed, Trip, Versatile S | 1d10P | 3kg | 20sp | Polearm | Advanced |

*Ranged Weapons*
| Name | Traits | Damage | Range | Weight | Price | Group | Category |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Big Boom Gun | Backstabber, Scatter 4m, Two-Handed | 1d8B | 30m | 1kg | 40sp | Firearm | Martial |
| Spoon Gun | Scatter 2m, Versatile P,S | 1d6B | 14m | 2kg | 30sp | Firearm | Advanced |

*Weapon Description*
* Slicer: A slicer is essentially a sharpened metal plate attached to a stick.
* Horsechopper: This goblin weapon is designed for battling horses and looks like a slicer, but with an even longer stick.
* Big Boom Gun: This comically oversized hand cannon was invented by a goblin who missed the 'hand' part. It is loaded with alarming quantities of gunpowder
* Spoon Gun: No ones entirely sure who developed the spoon gun, but all authorities agree that is was probably a goblin. Essentially a terrible idea in firearm form, the spoon gun is a spring powered hand cannon with a modified grip that uses miscellaneous knives, forks, chopsticks and spoons as amunition.

**Irongut**
You can subsist on food that most folks would consider spoiled. You can keep yourself fed with poor meals in a settlement as long as garbage is readily available, without using the Subsist downtime activity. You can eat and drink things when you are sickened.

In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws to prevent poison damage, the poisoned condition, and diseases.

**Unbreakable Goblin**
You’re able to bounce back from injuries easily due to an exceptionally thick skull, cartilaginous bones, or some other mixed blessing. You gain 10 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 6. When you fall, reduce the falling damage you take as though you had fallen half the distance.

**Very Sneaky**
Taller folk rarely pay attention to the shadows at their feet, and you take full advantage of this. You can move 2m farther when you take the Sneak action, up to your Speed. In addition, as long as you continue to use Sneak actions and succeed at your Stealth check, you don't become observed if you don't have cover or greater cover and aren't concealed at the end of the Sneak action, as long as you have cover or greater cover or are concealed at the end of your turn. 

## Halfling
*Claiming no place as their own, halflings control few settlements larger than villages. Instead, they frequently live among humans within the walls of larger cities, carving out small communities alongside taller folk. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadows of their larger neighbors, while others prefer a nomadic existence, traveling the world and taking advantage of opportunities and adventures as they come.*

Optimistic and cheerful, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easygoing, they are the best kind of opportunists, and their passions favor joy over violence. Even in the jaws of danger, halflings rarely lose their sense of humor.

Many taller people dismiss halflings due to their size or, worse, treat them like children. Halflings use these prejudices and misconceptions to their advantage, gaining access to opportunities and performing deeds of daring mischief or heroism. A halfling’s curiosity is tempered by wisdom and caution, leading to calculated risks and narrow escapes.

While their wanderlust and curiosity sometimes drive them toward adventure, halflings also carry strong ties to house and home, often spending above their means to achieve comfort in their homelife.

If you want to play a character who must contend with these opposing drives toward adventure and comfort, you should play a halfling.

You Might...
- Get along well with a wide variety of people and enjoy meeting new friends.
- Find it difficult to resist indulging your curiosity, even when you know it’s going to lead to trouble.
- Hold a deep and personal hatred of the practice of slavery and devote yourself to freeing those who still labor against their will.

Others Probably...
- Appreciate your ability to always find a silver lining or something to laugh about, no matter how dire the situation.
- Think you bring good luck with you.
- Underestimate your strength, endurance, and fighting prowess.

**Physical Description**

Halflings are short humanoids who look vaguely like smaller humans. They rarely grow to be more than 3 feet in height. Halfling proportions vary, with some looking like shorter adult humans with slightly larger heads and others having proportions closer to those of a human child.

Most halflings prefer to walk barefoot rather than wearing shoes, and those who do so develop roughly calloused soles on their feet over time. Tufts of thick, often-curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Halfling skin tones tend toward rich, tawny shades like amber or oak, and their hair color ranges from a light golden blond to raven black.

Halflings reach physical adulthood around the age of 20. A typical halfling can live to be around 150 years old.

**Society**

Despite their jovial and friendly nature, halflings don’t usually tend to congregate. They have no cultural homeland in the Inner Sea region, and they instead weave themselves throughout the societies of the world. Halflings eke out whatever living they can manage, many performing menial labor or holding simple service jobs. Some halflings reject city life, instead turning to the open road and traveling from place to place in search of fortune and fame. These nomadic halflings often travel in small groups, sharing hardships and simple pleasures among close friends and family.

Wherever halflings go, they seamlessly blend into the society they find themselves in, adapting to the culture of the predominant ancestry around them and adding their uniquely halfling twists, creating a blend of cultural diffusion that enriches both cultures.

**Alignment and Religion**
Halflings are loyal to their friends and their family, but they aren’t afraid to do what needs to be done in order to survive. Halfling alignments vary, typically closely in keeping with the alignment of the other ancestries that live around them. Halflings favor gods that either grant luck, like Desna, or encourage guile, like Norgorber, and many appreciate Cayden Cailean’s role as a liberator, as well as any religions common among other ancestries around them.

**Adventurers**
Halflings' natural wanderlust and opportunistic nature make them ideal adventurers. Many people put up with their vivacious attitudes in return for the natural talents they provide and the popular superstition that traveling with a halfling is good luck.

Typical backgrounds for halflings include acrobat, criminal, emissary, entertainer, laborer, and street urchin. Halflings make great clerics and rogues, but many also become monks or rangers.

**Names**
Halfling names are usually two to three syllables, with a gentle sound that avoids hard consonants. Preferring their names to sound humble, halflings see overly long or complex names as a sign of arrogance. This goes only for their own people, however—halflings have names that suit them, and they understand that elves and humans might have longer names to suit their own aesthetics. Humans in particular have a tendency to refer to halflings by nicknames, with “Lucky” being common to the point of absurdity.

**Sample Names**
Anafa, Antal, Bellis, Boram, Etune, Filiu, Jamir, Kaleb, Linna, Marra, Miro, Rillka, Sistra, Sumak, Yamyra

**Keen Eyes**
Your eyes are sharp, allowing you to make out small details about concealed or even invisible creatures that others might miss. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus when using the Seek action to find hidden or undetected creatures within 30 feet of you. When you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. 

### Feats

**Distracting shadows**
You have learned to remain hidden by using larger folk as a distraction to avoid drawing attention to yourself. You can use creatures that are at least one size larger than you (usually Medium or larger) as cover for the Hide and Sneak actions, though you still can't use such creatures as cover for other uses, such as the Take Cover action. 

**Gutsy**
Your family line is known for keeping a level head and staving off fear when the chips were down, making them wise leaders and sometimes even heroes. When you roll a success on a saving throw against an emotion effect, you get a critical success instead.

**Halfling luck**
Your happy-go-lucky nature makes it seem like misfortune avoids you, and to an extent, that might even be true. Once per day, as a Free action after having made a saving throw, you can reroll the triggering check, but you must use the new result, even if it’s worse than your first roll.

**Halfling Lore**
You've dutifully learned how to keep your balance or how to stick to the shadows where it's safe, important skills passed down through generations of halfling tradition. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Acrobatics or Stealth. You also become trained in Halfling Lore. 

**Hillock**
Accustomed to a calm life in the hills, your people find rest and relaxation especially replenishing, particularly when indulging in creature comforts. You regain 10 additonal hit points when you Rest. In addition, if you spend 1 hour eating a meal, you gain 1d6 temporary hit points.

**Twilight Halfling**
Your ancestors performed many secret acts under the concealing cover of dusk, whether for good or ill, and over time they developed the ability to see in twilight beyond even the usual keen sight of halflings. You gain low-light vision.

**Unfettered Halfling**
You were forced into service as a laborer, either pressed into indentured servitude or shackled by the evils of slavery, but you've since escaped and have trained to ensure you'll never be caught again. Whenever you roll a success on a check to Escape or a saving throw against an effect that would impose the grabbed or restrained condition on you, you get a critical success instead. Whenever a creature rolls a failure on a check to Grapple you, they get a critical failure instead. If a creature uses the Grab ability on you, it must succeed at an Athletics check to grab you instead of automatically grabbing you.

## Human
*As unpredictable and varied as any of the worlds peoples, humans have exceptional drive and the capacity to endure and expand. Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are among the most populous people in the realm*

Humans’ ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world’s predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.

If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.

You Might...

- Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.
- Seek to understand your purpose in the world.
- Cherish your relationships with family and friends.

Others Probably...

- Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.
- Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.
- Aren’t sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.

**Physical Description**

Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.

Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.

**Society**

Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.

**Alignment and Religion**

Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.

**Names**

Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.

**Sample Names**

Alban, Colan, Emall, Gerrarth, Ingling, Kerl, Marin, Opper, Qarta, Somen, Uverdan, Was-armid, Yttirg.

## Kobold
*Every kobold knows that their slight frame belies true, mighty draconic power. They are ingenious crafters and devoted allies within their warrens, but those who trespass into their territory find them to be inspired skirmishers, especially when they have the backing of a draconic sorcerer or true dragon overlord. However, these reptilian opportunists prove happy to cooperate with other humanoids when it’s to their benefit, combining caution and cunning to make their fortunes in the wider world.*

Kobolds are resourceful survivors whose snare-guarded warrens and opportunistic scavenging have cast them as villains to most other humanoids, with their draconic reverence lending them a reputation as mere minions and nuisances. Yet some kobolds have emerged from their secluded warrens seeking the relative safety of surface settlements, the lucrative prospects of the adventuring life, or validating awe from followers of their own.

If you want a character with oversized confidence, deadly cunning, and the ancient power of dragons flowing through their veins, you should play a kobold. 

You might...

- Take pride in your draconic connections, whether you believe dragons are your ancestors or simply patrons.
- Analyze your surroundings, always looking for ambushes, advantageous terrain, and escape routes.
- Naturally observe, adopt, and respect group dynamics, whether as leader, subordinate, or equal.

Others probably...

- Assume that you are cowardly and won’t stick around in the face of danger.
- Appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness, especially when it comes to building defenses.
- Consider your claims of draconic power to be overblown, delusional, or endearing.

**Physical Desciption**
Kobolds are short (about 3 feet tall) reptilian humanoids with slender bodies and long tails. They often boast distant draconic ancestry, and every kobold displays one or more draconic features, such as stout horns, razor-sharp teeth, or—more rarely—vestigial wings or draconic breath. They mature quickly, reaching adulthood by about 12 years and living to about 60.

The color of a kobold’s scales can vary widely. Most often, they mimic the hues of chromatic or metallic dragons, with a mix of slightly darker or lighter scales that create a mottled appearance. The scales of newly hatched kobolds often reflect the community’s draconic exemplar, whether that’s the dragon they currently serve or the dragon type from which they’re descended.

**Society**
Kobolds have an ingrained cautiousness that keeps them alive. They're secretive or subservient around powerful creatures to avoid becoming victims. This meekness fades once kobolds secure either a formidable patron (like a dragon) or a potent source of supernatural power (like an artifact or sorcerous leader). They often achieve an unshakable fervor and loyalty to their new cause or leader. However, kobolds are infamous for sensing a proverbial sinking ship, and once their source of power fails or seems doomed, their morale breaks swiftly.

Whether led by a dragon or not, kobolds almost always identify themselves with a type of dragon that serves as their spiritual exemplar. Their societies regularly adopt laws and cultural norms inspired by the exemplar's personality.

**Alignment and Religion**
All but the most iconoclastic kobolds have a natural respect for hierarchies and rules, and so kobolds are rarely chaotic. Kobold adventurers tend to be lawful neutral or neutral, relying on their ancestral social strategies for survival.

Organized religion feels natural for most kobolds, especially when a deity assumes a commanding or tyrannical disposition. Many gravitate toward Abadar's order or Shelyn's artistic flair. More sinister communities uphold Asmodeus and other archdevils as common patrons. The dragon deities Apsu and Dahak are also common subjects of worship. Kobolds also often find themselves drawn to cults, particularly those with dragons or devils as figureheads.

**Kobold Adventurers**
Kobolds often adventure in pursuit of the power, lore, and treasure that they feel befit their disproportionately large egos. When adventurers, militias, or careless tyrants shatter a kobold community, the survivors often latch onto new families, seeking emotional solace—and sometimes revenge. Typical kobold backgrounds include artisan, artist, criminal, hunter, miner, scout, and tinker from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, cultist, scavenger, and servant from this book. Kobolds excel as bards, rangers, rogues, and sorcerers, though they also often channel their ingenuity as alchemists or wizards.

**Names**
A young kobold’s given name is rarely more than a syllable or two. However, as they age, achieve status, and accomplish great deeds, kobolds add more syllables to their names, imitating a common draconic practice. Kobolds rarely have surnames except in an effort to better fit into a community, in which case they typically adopt the surname of an inspiring figure in that group.

**Sample Names**
Azrnak, Draahzin, Enga, Fazgyn, Fazij, Jekkajak, Kib, Kirrok, Mirkol, Tarka, Urkak, Varshez, Vroklan, Zekstikah, Zgaz

**Draconic Exemplar**
You draw minor powers from your draconic exemplar. Choose a type of chromatic or metallic dragon to be your exemplar. This determines your scale color and appearance, and dragons sometimes look more favorably upon those kobolds who resemble them, at the GM’s discretion. Your exemplar may also determine details of other abilities you have, using the Draconic Exemplars table.

### Feats
**Cringe**
With pitiful posturing, you cause your foe to pull back a deadly attack. As a reaction when a creature critically succeds on a Strike against you, you can cause the attacking creature to take a -3 circumstance penalty to the damage of the triggering Strike. This penalty applies after doubling the damage for a critical hit. The attacker is then immune to your Cringe for 24 hours.

**Dragon's Presence**
As a member of dragonkind, you project unflappable confidence (that collapses catastrophically against the deadliest foes). When you roll a success on a saving throw against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a failure against a fear effect, you get a critical failure instead.

In addition, when you attempt to Demoralize a creature of CR 8 or lower, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the Intimidation check.

**Dragonscaled Kobold**

As an action, you can channel your draconic exemplar's power into a gout of energy that manifests as a 12m line or a 6m cone, dealing 4d4+your highest ability damage. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against a DC of 10 + your highest ability. You can't use this ability again for 1d4 rounds.

You attentively learned key kobold survival strategies and mythology from your elders. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Stealth and Thievery. You also become trained in Kobold Lore.

**Snare Setter**
You are adept at the time-honored kobold art of trap making. You gain the trained proficiency in Crafting. If you were already trained in Crafting, you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain access to all uncommon kobold snares. You gain the Snare Crafting Skill feat, though when choosing your formulas for that feat, you can also choose from uncommon kobold snares, as well as common snares.

**Strongjaw Kobold**
Your bloodline is noted for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth. You gain a jaws unarmed attack that deals 1d8 piercing damage. Your jaws are in the brawling group and have the finesse and unarmed traits.

**Winglets**
You have small wings. Once per day, you can gain a flying speed of 8m for 1 minute. You also reduce any damage you take from a fall by 5.

## Orc
*Orcs are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born. As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, orcs revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance or raiding a neighboring settlement. Many orcs seek glory as soon as they can walk and carry a blade or club, taming wild beasts or hunting deadly monsters.*

Orcs often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an orc friend, however, soon learn that an orc's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Orc barbarians, fighters, and rangers are prized as gladiators and mercenaries. While some human settlements might be hesitant to accept an entire orc community into their midst, a small handful of orc mercenaries can do the job of an entire squad of human conscripts, so long as the orcs are well fed and well paid. Though the belief that orcs are only suited for battle is pervasive among other humanoids, the harsh orc mentality comes from a long history of conflict rather than a lack of ability in other areas.

Orc culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Orcs who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.

If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an orc.

You Might...
- Eagerly meet any chance to prove your strength in a physical contest.
- Believe that lies and treachery are for those who lack the strength to seize what they want. 
- View dying in glorious combat as preferable to a mundane death from old age or illness.

Others Probably...
- See you as violent or lacking in discipline.
- Underestimate your intellect, cunning, and knowledge.
- Admire your forthrightness and blunt honesty.

**Physical Description**

Orcs are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many orcs top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Orcs have rough skin, thick bones, and rock-hard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, orcs scar easily, and most orcs take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Orc skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some orcs have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.

Orcs consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful orc makes the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived. Similarly, many orcs consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many orcs also find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a significant amount of skin.

**Society**

Most orc communities define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An orc with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield.

Power in an orc hold comes from strength or family lineage. The structure tends to be feudal, with weaker orcs working at the behest of the strong. The Hold of Belkzen is the largest such society, and power changes hands there quickly. One mighty orc dying in battle can shake up an entire power structure, leading to squabbling and duels to decide control. Many orcs who tire of being subservient split off to form their own warbands, traveling to new territory.

Young orcs are typically raised by the entire community. Indeed, it would be almost impossible for orcs to raise their young any other way, since twins, triplets, and even quadruplets are quite common in orc families, as are deaths among orcs in their child-rearing years. Many orc holds conduct ceremonies when a young orc comes of age, typically around their tenth or eleventh birthday, during which the new adults are told what their role in the hold will be. For communities that practice ritual scarification or tattooing, this is often when the young orcs receive their first hold-scar or tattoo as well.

Orcs fear very little, but most distrust magic. Magic is seen as a tool that bypasses the physical and allows the weak to contend with the strong, a belief that runs at odds with orc values. While they respect the physical might of Gorumite warpriests, and even druids who take on the forms of great beasts, they find arcane and occult magic questionable at best and unethical on the whole. All but the most depraved orc communities see necromancy as a foul art that steals glory from the dead, and their growing struggles against the undead have given them newfound common ground with their humanoid neighbors.

**Alignment and Religion**

A common orc saying is, “You are the scars that shape you.” Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most orcs tend heavily toward chaotic alignments. Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug are all commonly worshiped among orc communities, though less violent holds worship nature deities like Gozreh or gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to orc sensibilities.

While there are orc deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among orcs. Orcs believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some orc holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the orc deities for a place amid the pantheon. Most orcs don't waste their dying moments praising the divine or praying for a place in the afterlife, but spitting a blood-flecked warning at their deities, promising a new challenger through broken teeth.

**Adventurers**

An orc's drive to overcome challenges and prove themself spurs many orcs to become adventurers, though orcs are more likely to set out on their own or with other orcs than alongside adventurers of other ancestries.

Common orc backgrounds include gladiator, hunter, martial disciple, nomad, and warrior from the Core Rulebook, plus bandit, outrider, and refugee from this book. Orcs thrive in martial archetypes like barbarian and berserker.

**Names**
Orcs have a harsh, guttural language, and their naming conventions are no exception. Many orc names are simply the Orcish word for a particularly desirable trait, such as great strength, height, or ferocity. Orcs commonly use either their hold name or a name referencing a particularly memorable accomplishment as 
their surname.

## Warforged
*Warforged are armored constructs created for war and violence. The first warforged were mindless automatons, but an unexpected breakthrough produced fully sentient soldiers, blending organic and inorganic materials. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. While originally built for war, many have found a calling outside of these brutal environments, or been abandoned after the war has ended. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killing machine, or a visionary in search of purpose and meaning.*

Warforgeds are powerful constructs created with ancient technology from past human civilisations. They take on a variety of different forms, ranging from almost human to a tank with retractable pincers. Their strength, cunning, and versatility make them extraordinarily great combatants, and some nations have therefore created squadrons of these robots, despite their elevated cost. 

**You might:**
- Plan ahead, preparing multiple contingencies for even simple tasks.
- Calculate the repercussions of your actions, inventions, and thoughts before sharing them.
- See the logical value of everything

**Others probably**
- See you as only fit for war
- Marvel at the extraordinary technology used to create you
- View you as a mindless, emotionless killing machine

**Physical description**
Warforged have a wooden core covered partially with shining steel plates. Glowing green weins go through their green and brown bodies. Beyond this, warorged have drastically different appearences. Some barely reach the waist of a human, while others stand over 5 meters tall. They are generally very heavy for their size, weighing between 50 kilos for the small ones, to multiple tons. 

Warforged are created to have similar senses to most demi- and near-humans. They can detect light, sound, and have many touch detectors located on their bodies. Since warforged are constructs, they are immune to dying of old age and can theoretically live forever with constant repairs.

**History**
Around 30 years ago, a group of explorers discovered what looked like an ancient battlefield littered with millions of partly destroyed robots. The technology used in constructing these robots had been partially preserved by their adamantine shells. By reverse-engineering these robots, the Alliance of worlds were able to create the warforgeds. Shortly after being built, they were implemented into almost all nations’ armies and managed to drive the pitnarcs away from Near space.

**Society**
Warforged have no society on their own as most live as soldiers in service to different nations, or organizations. Some warforgeds also work as bounty hunters, or have gained independence when their creator or employer died. A few warforged communities are also found in large cities in previously war-ravaged countries. Many warforgeds in these communities work tirelessy to give warforged the same rights as their biological companions.

**Names**
Most warforged are simply assigned a number, but they sometimes are given names by their comrades or to blend into society. Warforged names range from common names from any species, to more menacing sounding names.
AT-5437, Blue-12, Bonebreaker, Eleven, Goldfire, Stonecrusher, Silverclaw, Warsmasher.

**Adventurers**
While most warforged are remain soldiers, some are created for special operations, while others have become independent. They typically adventure under direct assignment of a military, but some are specifically created to do good and save lives or have separeted from the military that created them.

**Constructed anatomy**
Thanks to your robotic anatomy, you are immune to poison and disease, and effects that would give you the drained, or sickened conditions. You also don’t need to eat or drink and are immune to effects that would put you to sleep. To rest, you must spend 6 hours in an inert  state, though you remain conscious.

**Damage control**
You are immune to the dying condition. Unlike most constructs, when reduced to 0 hit points, you become unconscious, but are automatically stabilized (you are still subject to the rules for instant death, such as death effects, and taking more damage than your hit point maximum + your current hit points) If a creature uses a three-action activity to repair you and succeeds at a DC 15 engineering check, you regain 1 hit point. If you remain unconscious for 1d4+1 hours, you regain 1 hit point. Keep track of  the damage taken while at 0 hit points. If, at any point, the total damage taken is greater than half your hit points maximum, you automatically die and are destroyed.

**Electricity vulnerability**
Due to your constructed nature you gain Weakness 3 to lightning damage.

**Equipment integration**
You can integrate weapons or armor into your body. To integrate an item, you must spend 1 hour working with the item in your possession. An integrated weapon uses the normal amount of arms a weapon of that type would, but it can’t be disarmed and requires 1 hour of work to take off or on. An integrated armor is melded to your body and can’t be removed by anyone else and it requires 1 hour of work for you to take it off or on. You can sleep in your integrated armor without suffering any penalties.

### Feats
**Dual Form**
Your body is specifically modified to being able to change into two different forms. You can use an action to change your shape into a vehicle, or to change back. While in your vehicle form, your walking speed increases by 6 meters (4 squares), but you can only take actions with the move trait and can’t wield weapons. When you transform, you can choose to have your worn equipment be placed in a compartment inside your vehicle form, or to still be worn. 
    
**Impersonator**
Your body was augmented with processes and an appearance intended to blend in with humans more easily. You become trained in Deception (or another skill if you're already trained in Deception). You don't require a disguise kit when attempting Deception checks to Impersonate a human. In addition, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend that you're a human version of yourself, rather than a warforged. This bonus doesn't apply to other checks to Impersonate humans.

**Integrate Equipment**
You have learned how to integrate Adventuring gear (See Equipment; adventuring gear) into your body. To integrate an item, you must spend 1 hour working with the item in your possession. Any integrated gear can’t be disarmed, requires 1 hour of work to take off or on, and doesn’t occupy any hands. It still takes the normal amount of time or actions to manipulate.

**Metallic body**
The materials you are composed of resists ailments that attack the flesh. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus against being paralyzed, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, and against saving throws caused by an effect with the Mental trait.
