# Equipment
To make your mark on the world, you’ll need to have the right equipment, including armor, weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents the various equipment that you can purchase during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities and other large settlements.

Your character starts out with 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased only if you have special access from abilities you selected during character creation or your GM gives you permission to purchase them.

Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them using the Crafting skill, or purchase them from a merchant.

## Armor
Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your armor provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re wearing it.

### Armor Rules

#### Armor class
Your Armor Class (AC) measures how well you can defend against attacks. When a creature attacks you, your Armor Class is the DC for that attack roll.

Armor Class = 10 + Dexterity modifier (up to your armor’s Dex Cap) + armor’s item bonus to AC + other bonuses + penalties

If you are wearing armor you are not proficienct in, you take a -4m penalty to speed and you halve the armor's item bonus to AC (round down as normal).

#### Donning and doffing armor
Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning and removing armor are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to remove or doff any armor.

#### Category
The armor’s category (unarmored, light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor) indicate which proficiency is used to determine if you are proficient in your armor or not.

#### AC bonus
This number is the item bonus you add for the armor when determining Armor Class.

#### Dexterity modifier cap (Dex cap)
This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity modifier that can apply to your AC while you are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing that armor.

#### Check penalty
While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to Might- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor’s Might threshold (see the Might column above), you don’t take this penalty.

#### Speed penalty
While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in this entry to your Speed, as well as to any other movement types you have, such as a climb Speed or swim Speed, to a minimum Speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor’s Might threshold (see the Might column above), you reduce the penalty by 2m.

#### Group
Each type of armor belongs to an armor group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, but they are also used to determine the hit points of the armor. Armor rarely takes damage, but a few abilities can damage armor.

| Name | Hardness | HP |
|---|---|---|
| Cloth | 2 | 8 |
| Leather | 4 | 16 |
| Chain | 8 | 36 |
| Composite | 9 | 36 |
| Plate | 10 | 40 |

## Shields
While many are content with the defense their armor gives them, others supplement themselves with a shield. Shields give you a circumstance bonus to AC and can also be used to make Strikes. 

### Shield Rules

#### Donning or doffing shield
Unless stated otherwise, donning og doffing a shield takes 1 Interact action.

#### Shields as weapons
If you make a Strike with a weapon it deals the damage listed in the damage column. A trait in the Traits column not listed in under Shield Traits is described in the Weapon Traits section and applies to Strikes made using the shield. All shields are Martial weapons in the Shield weapon group.

#### Speed penalty
Some shields are particularly heavy or otherwise inhibit movement and thereby gives a speed penalty to anyone who is wielding it. As normal, this penalty applies to all the reciever's speeds.

#### Hit points
Shields have hit points and hardness based on their weight. While they are made with different materials, all shields are designed to be as sturdy as possible and the materials therefore matters little. Each shield has Hardness equal to their weight in kilos, and hit points equal to five times their weight.

**Fortress Shield** Standing almost 2m tall, this colossal shield provides great protection to those with the strength to carry it.

**Harnessed Shield** This large steel shield features a specialized opening to hold lances and similar weapons. Harnessed shields are a common backup for those who fight with jousting weapons in case they're forced into combat without their mounts. Balancing the weapon within the shield's hold is somewhat awkward, and longer weapons, like lances, need to be held closer to the body than usual for proper support.

**Heather Shield** These classic shields are among the most commonly used due to their versatile nature and ease of equipping.

**Hide Shield** Hide shields are made of the hide of an animal supported by wooden planks. This makes the shield especially good at resisting and reducing incoming force.

**Hook Shield** A round wooden shield with the edges covered in steel from which a large hook protrudes. The hook is positioned over the hand and allows the shield to be used for various combat maneuvers, such as grappling and disarming.

**Insulator Shield** These relatively large composite shields are made of mix of layers of many differen materials to protect the wielder from extreme cold or heat.

**Kite Shield** Kite shields take their name for their resemblance to kites. These shields protects well the legs and are commonly used while mounted.

**Meteor Shield** Part shield, part throwing weapon, Meteor shields are lighweight wooden shield with a metal edge who are designed to be thrown in an emergency.

**Missile Cather** These large thin metal shields are designed to lessen the impact or ranged projectiles. However, du to its size, it is diffult to protect against melee attacks.

**Negator Shield** Negator shields are specifically treated to ground eletricity and prevent acidic chemical reactions. These and Insulator shields are commonly used by dragon hunters to protect against the creatures' breath weapons.

**Pavise** Somtimes called portable walls, pavises are meant to be placed on the ground to give cover to archers, crossbowmen, and spellslingers hiding behing.

**Razor disc** More weapon than shield, this hand-held metal disc features a razor-sharp edge and can be thrown over surprisingly long distances.

**Round Shield** The most commonly used shields. Round shields are made mostly of wood, but have a metal edge and core. They are versatile and relatively light, allowing them to easely intercept most attacks.

**Spiked Shield** These wooden shields have a large metal spike in the center, allowing the shield to be used both for offense and defense, but the heavy spike also causes the shield to require more effort to wield effectively.

**Swordstealer Shield** Swordstealer shields are have numerous cuts around the edge to allow it to trap and reduce the impact from swords and other slashing weapons.

**Tower Shield** These massive shields can be used to provide cover to nearly the entire body. Due to their size, they are typically made of wood reinforced with metal.

### Shield Traits
**Cumbersome**
Wielding a Cumbersome shield is no small task. A creature holding a Cumbersome shield is Immobilized unless its Might score equals or is higher than the bonus listed.

**Dart-thrower**
A shield with this trait has an integrated dart thrower and can be used to make ranged Strikes with the dart thrower. See the Weapon section below.

**Deflect**
This shield is paricularly adapted at deflecting a certain type of damage. Whenever the wielder takes damage of the the type listed, reduce the damage by the number listed.

**Dual**
Shields with the Dual trait are meant to be paired. If you are holding a shield with the Dual trait in each hand, the circumstance bonus from the shield increases to the listed amount.

**Freestanding**
A shield with the Freestanding trait is practically a mobile wall. As an Interact action while wielding the shield, it can be doffed and positioned on the ground in an unoccupied adjacent 2m³ square. While posistioned in this way, it gived its circumstance bonus to AC to any creatures standing adjacent to it who is targeted by an attack that would pass through the square the shield is positioned in. To determine whether an attack would pass through the square the shield is positioned in, draw a straight line from the center of the attacker to the center of the target. If it passes through the square the shield in positioned in, the circumstance bonus applies. If the line only passes through the edge of the shield, the GM may rule only half the circumstance bonus applies.

**Harnessed**
This shield type features a special brace or opening designed to hold lances or other jousting weapons. Jousters often use these shields as a backup in narrow passages and other places where they're unable to ride a mount. You can use the Interact action to lock a weapon with the jousting trait in place in the shield, enabling you to use two hands to wield the shield and weapon simultaneously. If you're not wielding the combined unit with both hands, you can use neither the weapon nor the shield.

While you are wielding the shield, you can gain the jousting benefit of a weapon as if you were mounted. Because a significant portion of the weapon needs to be braced behind the shield, the weapon's reach is reduced by 5 feet if it is greater than 5 feet.

**Quick equip**
This type of shield is designed to be donned and doffed quickly. You can don or doff this shield as a Free action.

**Raise**
You can use an action to focus on defending with the shield, increasing the circumstance bonus to AC to the listed amount.

**Versatile defense**
Shields with the Versatile defense trait can be easily positioned in the gaps of any other protection you may have. If you a wielding a shield with this trait and you would gain a circumstance bonus to AC from another source, you increase the circumstance bonus to AC from the shield by 1 while you would gain this circumstance bonus. This increase only applies once and the circumstance bonus provided by the shield can therefore never increase by more than 1 due to this feature.

### Critical Specialization Effects
Each weapon adds a different additional effect on a critical hit, in addition to doubling the damage as normal. This is called a critical specialization effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical specialization effect of your weapon.

#### Axe
Choose one creature adjacent to the initial target and within reach. If its AC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled. This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.

#### Bow
If the target of the critical hit is adjacent to a surface, it gets stuck to that surface by the missile. The target is immobilized and must spend an Interact action to attempt a DC 10 Athletics check to pull the missile free; it can't move from its space until it succeeds. The creature doesn't become stuck if it is incorporeal, is liquid (like a water elemental or some oozes), or could otherwise escape without effort. 

#### Brawling
The target must succeed at a Might save against your personal DC or be slowed 1 until the end of your next turn. 

#### Club
You knock the target away from you up to 10 feet (you choose the distance). This is forced movement. 

#### Firearm
The target must succeed at a Might save against your personal DC or be stunned 1.

#### Hammer
The target is knocked prone. 

#### Knife
The target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. 

#### Pick
The weapon viciously pierces the target, who takes 4 additional damage.

#### Polearm
The target is moved 5 feet in a direction of your choice. This is forced movement. 

#### Shield
You knock the target back 5 feet away from you. This is forced movement.

#### Sling
You shoot the target in its eye, it must succed on a Might saving throw against your personal DC or become Dazzled until the end of its next turn.

#### Spear
The weapon pierces the target, weakening its attacks. The target is clumsy 1 until the start of your next turn.

#### Sword
The target is made off-balance by your attack, becoming flat-footed until the start of your next turn.
