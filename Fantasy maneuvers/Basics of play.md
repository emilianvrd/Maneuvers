### Empower
When performing a Flourish, a you can choose to Empower it. The flourish you want to Empower must be one that can be used 3 times per day and you must have all uses left. When you empower a Flourish, it deals double the damage it normally deals. A Flourish sometimes also or instead adds special abilities when Empowered.

## Spells 
Performing an action with the Spell trait is called casting a spell. The first time you select an ability with the Spell trait, choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The chosen ability becomes your spellcasting ability and is often referenced in Fighting Moves and Flourishes and sometimes in Talents, Archtypes and other features or abilities. Your spell attack modifier is 4 (the proficieny bonus) + your spellcasting ability.

## Hands
A character often need to use their hands. For the most part, the GM will use common sense to determine if a character needs their hands and how many. A character always needs a free hand to wield a weapon or to cast a spell. If the character uses both hands to wield a single Melee weapon, increase the damage die by two steps (1d4->1d8, 1d6->1d10, and so on). As normal for increasing damage dice, if increasing the die size by two steps isn't possible, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each step that isn't possible, instead. If a character performs a Fighting move with the Spell trait while both their hands are free, or they are wielding a staff or other spellcasting foci in one hand and the other hand is free, increase the damage die by two steps aswell. If the Figting move deals multiple dice of damage, this rule does not apply, although many have other effects when performed while both the performers hands are free, or they are wielding a staff or other spellcasting foci in one hand and the other hand is free.

## Saving Throws
A saving throw is a special type of ability check. Each type of ability score corresponds to one type of saving throw, also called simply a save. Unless explicitly written otherwise, whenever an opponent uses an ability against a PC, the PC must attempt a saving throw against the opponents Save Difficulty Class (SDC, or Save DC). Sometimes the PC's must instead attempt a saving throw to resist an environmental effect, a hazard, or a trap.

You can always choose to Critically Fail a saving throw instead of rolling.

There are six different types of saving throws: 
- Might saving throws: These saving throws are used to resist poison and disease and to avoid exhaustion and fatigue and other saving throws that depends on being healthy or tough. Might saving throws are often also used to avoid being moved or knocked prone and other saving throws where being strong would help.
- Dexterity saving throws: Dexterity saving throws are the most common type of saving throw and is used to dodge an opponents blade, quickly leap away from an exploding fireball and other effects you could avoid by reacting or moving quickly. Many types of armor grants an Item Bonus to Dexterity saving throws, but might impose a restriction on the maximum Dexterity you can apply.
- Intelligence saving throws: These saving throws are used to see through illusion, resist psychic attacks, and to resist other abilities you can use logic and sound reasoning to see through.
- Wisdom saving throws: Resisting effects that charm, frighten or otherwise affect your willpower is a wisdom saving throw.
- Charisma saving throws: Charisma saving throws are used to withstand possesion, banishment, and other effects through sheer force of personality.

### Basic Saves
On a Success, the character dodges or otherwise resist the ability, removing or reducing the effect. Many abilities, especially those that only deal damage, note that it requieres a Basic save or Basic saving throw to resist. Use the following degrees of success:
**Critical Success**: The character is unaffected.
**Success**: The character takes half damage.
**Failure**: The character takes full damage.
**Critical Failure**: The character takes double damage.

### Basic Attacks
A Basic Attack is similar to a Basic Save, but is used by PCs instead of monsters. If an ability requieres you to make a Basic Attack, use the following degrees of success:
**Critical Success**: The target takes double damage.
**Success**: The target takes full damage.
**Failure**: The target takes half damage.
**Critical Failure**: The target takes double damage.

### Calculating Saving Throw Modifiers
To calculate your modifier to a specific saving throw, use the following formula:

Ability (Might, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) + Proficiency bonus (if you have an ability that says it applies) + Other bonuses + Other penalties.

### Attacks Against Multiple Creatures

### Optional Rule: Attack
If ability lets you make a single attack against multiple creatures, you can have the player roll a separate attack against each target or use the following rules instead. 

First, subtract the targets' Defense DC to the result of the attack. the use the following table to determine the degree of success of your attack on each creature.

| Attack - Defense DC | Critical Failures | Failures | Successes | Critical Successes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| -18 or lower | Everyone | – | – | – |
| -13 to -17 | 3/4 | 1/4 | – | – |
| -8 to -12 | 1/2 | 1/2 | – | – |
| -3 to -7 | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4 | – |
| 2 to -2 | – | 1/2 | 1/2 | – |
| 3 to 7 | – | 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4 |
| 8 to 12 | – | – | 1/2 | 1/2 |
| 13 to 17 | – | – | 1/4 | 3/4 |
| 18 or higher| – | – | – | Everyone |

If you can't divide the creatures evenly, give them the result with the highest chance of happening, or the worst one, if the results are equally likely.

## Experience
At the end of a session, give all the players 1XP and another point of XP for each of the following any player did. Once the players have gotten a total of 10XP, they go up a level and reset their XP to 0 plus any leftover XP if they had more than 10 experience.
