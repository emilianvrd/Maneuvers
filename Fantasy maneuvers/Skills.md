# Skills
Skills represent your training in a specific field. When you make a skill check, you roll 1d20 and add a relevant ability score. If you have proficiency in a skill, you also add the proficiency bonus of +4 to the skill check. The GM determines which ability score to add and if your proficiency in a skill applies.
