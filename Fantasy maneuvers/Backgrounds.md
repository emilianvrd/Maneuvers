# Backgrounds
Before you became an adventurer, your character likely had another occupation or had some events that significantly changed the character. At 1st level when you create your character, you gain a background of your choice. This decision is permanent; you can't change it at later levels. Each background listed here grants two ability boosts, three Talent, and proficiency in six skills, one of which is a lore skill, and four Skills of your choice. If you gain the proficiency in a skill from your background and would then become proficient in the same skill from another source at 1st level, you instead become proficient in another skill of your choice.
