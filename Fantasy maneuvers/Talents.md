# Talents
Talents are an integral part of your character. They determine much of what you can do during exploration and social interaction.

## 1st

### Advanced First Aid
Medicine\
Constant\
You use your medical training to ameliorate sickness or assuage fears. When you use Medicine to Administer First Aid, instead of Stabilizing a character or Stopping Bleeding, you can reduce an ally's frightened or sickened condition by 2, or remove either of those conditions entirely on a critical success. You can remove only one condition at a time. The DC for the Medicine check is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition.

### Alarm
Spell\
10 minutes\
You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

You can have no more than one Alarm active at a time.

### Animal Friendship
Beasts, Nature, Spell\
2 actions\
This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within 12m of you. It must see and hear you. If the beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

### Animal Messenger
Beasts, Nature, Spell\
10 minutes\
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before 24 hours have passed, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

### Assurance
Skill\
Constant\
You never fail when doing what you are best at. Choose one Skill you have proficiency in. When you would make an ability check using that skill, you can instead choose to gain a result of 10 + the relevant Ability Modifier. Circumstance, status, and item bonuses and penalties applies as normal, but not your proficiency bonus.

### Breath Control
Constant\
You have incredible breath control, which grants you advantages when air is hazardous or sparse. You can hold your breath for 25 times as long as usual before suffocating. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against inhaled threats, such as inhaled poisons, and if you roll a success on such a saving throw, you get a critical success instead.

### Cat fall
Acrobatics\
1 reaction\
You have learned special techniques to fall without hurting yourself. When you would take damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to treat the fall as 20m shorter for the purpose of determining how much damage you deal.

### Charming Liar
Deception\
Constant\
Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When you get a critical success using the Lie action, the target’s attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you’d succeeded at using Diplomacy to Make an Impression. This works only once per conversation, and if you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature’s attitude to improve. You must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate your status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can’t achieve.

### Codebreaker
Society\
Constant\
Your skill with languages and codes is so great that you can decipher information with little more than a quick read through a text. You can Decipher Writing using Society while reading at normal speed. If you slow down and spend the full amount of time that’s ordinarily required and roll a success, you get a critical success; if you critically succeed while spending the normal amount of time, you gain a nearly word-for-word understanding of the document. 

In addition, you can use Society instead of Insight to detect when a creature is lying and you gain a +1 Circumstance bonus to your roll if you do.

### Confabulator
Deception\
Constant\
Even when caught in falsehoods, you pile lie upon lie. Reduce the circumstance bonus a target gains for your previous attempts to Create a Diversion or Lie to it from +4 to +1. 

### Continual Recovery
Medicine\
Constant\
You zealously monitor a patient’s progress to administer treatment faster. When you Treat Wounds, your patient becomes immune for only 1 hour instead of a day. This applies only to your Treat Wounds activities, not any other the patient receives.

### Dancing Lights
Light, Spell\
Free action\
You create four dancing lights at different points within 20m of you. Each dancing light sheds bright light for up to 6m and dim light for an additional 6m. As a Free action on subsequent turns, you can move each of the lights to a different posisition within 20m of you. If at any point one of the lights are more than 20m from you, that light fades.

The lights fades after 10 minutes have passed or if you use this Talent again.

### Detect Magic
Divination, Spell\
2 actions\
For 1 minute, you sense the presence of magic within 10m of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Detect Poison and Disease
Divination, Spell\
1 hour\
For 1 minute, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 10m of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Detect Thoughts
Divination, Spell\
10 minutes\
A creature within 10m of you must make Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you immediatly learns its surface thoughts(what it is thinking the most about at the moment).

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

### Disguise Self
Illusion, Spell\
2 actions\
You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until 1 hour have passed or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem up to 30cm shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. 

You can cast this spell twice per day.

### Druidcraft
Nature, Plant\
1 action\
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

* You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb  for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
* You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect  must fit in a 5-foot cube.
* You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the ground, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
* You cause the area to become owergrown, making it to difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. 

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. 

### Environmental Adaption
Survival\
Constant\
You rapidly adapt to environments through a skill and knowledge. After spending an hour in an environment of severe cold or colder, you are protected from the effects of severe cold until you leave that environment. After spending an hour in an environment of severe heat or hotter, you are protected from the effects of severe heat until you leave that environment.

### Exhort the Faithful
Religion\
Constant\
Your knowledge of the tenets of your faith gives you insight into the best ways to get others of your faith to help you or to follow your directions. When you Request something of or Coerce members of your own faith, you can attempt a Religion check instead of Diplomacy or Intimidation, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. On a critically failed attempt to make a Request, the target's attitude toward you doesn't worsen.

You must be a follower of a specific religion to choose this Talent.

### Experienced Professional
Lore\
You carefully safeguard your professional endeavors to prevent disaster. When you use Lore to Earn Income, if you roll a critical failure, you instead get a failure. You also gain twice as much income from a failed check to Earn Income, unless it was originally a critical failure.

### Fast Jump
Movement\
1 action\
You can use High Jump and Long Jump as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don’t perform the initial Stride (nor do you fail if you don’t Stride 10 feet). In addition, you increase the vertical distance you move when you High Jump by 2m and the horizontal distance you move when you Long Jump by 4m.

### Foil Senses
Stealth\
Constant\
You are adept at foiling creatures' special senses and cautious enough to safeguard against them at all times. Whenever you use the Avoid Notice, Hide, or Sneak actions, you are always considered to be taking precautions against special senses (see the Detecting with Other Senses sidebar).

### Forager
Survival\
Constant\
While using Survival to Subsist, if you roll any result worse than a success, you get a success. On a success, you can provide subsistence living for yourself and four additional creatures, and on a critical success, you can take care of twice as many creatures as on a success.

Multiple smaller creatures or creatures with significantly smaller appetites than a human are counted as a single creature for this feat, and larger creatures or those with significantly greater appetites each count as multiple creatures. The GM determines how much a non-human creature needs to eat.

In addition, when you forage, you also learn what plants, fungi, and animals are prevalent in the region.

### Forensic Acumen
Medicine\
Constant\
You understand the principles of forensic medicine, making you better at examining a body to determine the cause of death or injury. You can perform a forensic examination on a body, as described under Recall Knowledge in the Medicine skill, in half the normal amount of time it would take (to a minimum of 5 minutes). If you succeed at your check, you can attempt an immediate check to Recall Knowledge to follow up on something you found, with a +5 circumstance bonus. This check is usually related to the cause of injury or death, such as a Crafting check to identify a poison or weapon that was used or an additional Medicine check to identify a specific disease. If you prefer, you can instead attempt to Recall Knowledge about the type of creature whose body you were examining, using the appropriate skill and gaining the same circumstance bonus.

### Free Squeeze
Acrobatics\
Constant\
You are particularly good at rapidly squeezing into and through tight spaces. You can Squeeze a Free action, and you gain a +3 circumstance bonus to any check you required to Squeeze.

### Freedom of Movement
Acrobatics\
Constant\
You are adept at escaping grapples and restraints. You gain a +3 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to Escape.

### Guide
Survival\
Constant\
You know the wilderness so well that you can help your party travel through it with ease. When you are setting the path for your party through wilderness terrain, your party gains a +4m circumstance bonus to its Speed for the purpose of calculating the party's travel speed, your party's travel speed doesn't decrease in difficult terrain, and greater difficult terrain halves your party's travel speed instead of reducing it to a third. This doesn't increase your party's Speed during an encounter or allow your party to ignore difficult terrain during an encounter.

### Group Coercion
Intimidation\
Constant\
When you Coerce, you can compare your Intimidation check result to the Will DCs of four targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. 

### Group Impression
Diplomacy\
When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the Will DCs of four targets instead of one. It’s possible to get a different degree of success for each target. 

### Hefty Hauler
Athletics\
Constant\
You can carry more than most. Increase the amount of weight you can carry before becoming encumbered by 20kg. You also gain a +1 Circumstance bonus against effects that would make you Fatigued.

### Hidden Disguise
Deception\
You always have a the tools necessery to craft disguises. You can create or don a disguise as a two-action activity.

### Identify
Divination, Spell\
10 minutes\
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

You can cast this spell three times per day.

### Impeccable Crafting
Crafting\
Constant\
You craft flawless creations with great efficiency. Whenever you roll a success at a Crafting check to make an item, you get a critical success instead.

### Impressive Display

You perform a feat of strength, impressing those nearby. For the next minute, you gain a +1 Status bonus on Deception, Persuasion, Performance, and Intimidation checks against those who saw your display.

### Jack of all Trades
Constant\
You have learnt a little bit of everything. When you attempt a skill check in which you do not add your proficiency bonus, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.

### Jump
Spell\
1 action\
You touch a creature. The creature’s jump distance is tripled for 1 hour.

You can use this Talent three times per day.

### Lasting Coercion
Intimidation\
When you successfully Coerce someone, the maximum time they comply increases to a week, still determined by the GM. In addition, when you get a Critical Failure on a check to Coerce someone, you get a Failure instead.

### Legendary Performer
Performance\
Constant\
Your fame has spread throughout the lands. NPCs who succeed at a DC 10 Society check to Recall Knowledge have heard of you and usually have an attitude toward you one step better than normal, depending on your reputation and the NPC’s disposition. For instance, if you’re well-known for cruel and demanding behavior, creatures might be intimidated by you, rather than be friendly toward you. When you Earn Income with Performance, you attract better audiences than your location would allow, as audiences flock to see you. In general, this increases what you earn by 50%. 

### Legendary Savant
Lore\
Constant\
Your fame has spread throughout the lands due to your impressive Lore (for instance, if you have Warfare Lore, you might be a legendary general or tactician). This works as Legendary Performer, except you gain better jobs when you Earn Income with Lore.

### Light
Light, Spell\
1 action\
You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. 

### Line Dancer
Skill\
Constant\
You have improved your balance by training on narrow lines. You gain a +3 circumstance bonus to Balance and a +1 Circumstance bonus against being Shoved and knocked prone.

### Linguist
Language\
Constant\
You learn 3 languages of your choice. In addition, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Society checks to decipher a text.

### Mage hand
Spell\
1 action\
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.
The hand lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 12m away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 1m each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 5kg. 

### Magical crafting
Arcana, Crafting\
You can Craft magic items, though some have other requirements.

### Mending
Crafting\
1 minute
You repairs a single break or tear in an object within 4m of you, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloack, or a leaking wineskin.
As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

You can physically repair a magic item or construct with this ability, but doing so will not restore magic to such an object. 

### Message
Spell\
1 action\
You point your finger toward a creature within 30m and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

### Minor illusion
Illusion, Spell\
2 actions\
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the 1 minute. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than 1m cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

You can have no more than one illusion created by this spell at a time.

### Nature's Form
Nature, Spell\
2 actions\
Once per day, you can activate this ability to turn into an animal of Challenge Rating 0. All you statistics and abilities are replaced by the statistics and abilities of the beast, except your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You still retain your personality and return to your original form in 1 hour or until you spend an action do end the spell.

### Natural Medicine
Nature\
Constant\
You can apply natural cures to heal your allies. You can use Nature instead of Medicine to Treat Wounds. If you’re in the wilderness, you might have easier access to fresh ingredients, allowing you to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your check to Treat Wounds using Nature, subject to the GM’s determination.

### Pickpocket
Sleight of hand\
1 action\
You can Steal or Palm an Object that’s closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can’t steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you’re a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard, but you take a –5 penalty when you do so.

### Prestidigation
Spell\
1 action\
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
* You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 30cm² of nonliving material for 1 minute.
* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 minute.
* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can only have one of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. 

### Quiet Allies
Stealth\
Constant\
You’re skilled at moving with a group. When you are Avoiding Notice and your allies Follow the Expert, you and those allies can roll a single Stealth check, using the lowest modifier, instead of rolling separately. This doesn’t apply for initiative rolls.

### Relentless Tracker
Survival\
Constant\
You are an experienced tracker. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to tracking and can track at full speed without penalty. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to avoid exhastion when tracking a creature.

### Robust Recovery
Medicine\
Constant\
You learned folk medicine to help recover from diseases and poison, and using it diligently has made you especially resilient. When you Treat a Disease or a Poison, or someone else uses one of these actions on you, increase the circumstance bonus granted on a success to +5, and if the result of the patient’s saving throw is a success, the patient gets a critical success.

### Shameless Request
Diplomacy\
Constant\
You can downplay the consequences or outrageousness of your requests using sheer brazenness and charm. When you Request something, you reduce any DC increases for making an outrageous request by 2, and if you roll a critical failure for your Request, you get a failure instead. While this means you can never cause your target to reduce their attitude toward you by making a Request, they eventually tire of requests, even though they still have a positive attitude toward you.

### Shape water
Spell, Water\
2 actions\
You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube.
You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 2m in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
* You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 minute.
* You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 minute.
* You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 minute.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than one of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. 

### Sign Language
Society\
Constant\
You learn the sign languages associated with the languages you know, allowing you to sign and understand signs. Sign languages typically require both hands to convey more complex concepts, and they are visual rather than auditory.

Sign language is difficult to understand during combat due to the level of attention needed, unlike basic gestures like pointing at a foe to suggest a target. Sign language is hard to use in areas of low visibility, just like speech is difficult in a noisy environment.

### Skilled
Constant\
You become proficent in a new skill of your choice.

Special: You can select this feat multiple times. Each time you do, select a new skill to become proficient in.

### Smuggler
Stealth\
Constant\
You often smuggle things past the authorities. You automatically succeed at hiding small concealed items from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for hidden items. 

### Speciality Crafting
Your training focused on Crafting one particular kind of item. Select one of the specialties listed below; you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Crafting checks to Craft items of that type. If it’s unclear whether the specialty applies, the GM decides. Some specialties might apply only partially. For example, if you were making a morningstar and had specialty in woodworking, the GM might give you half your bonus because the item requires both blacksmithing and woodworking.

| Specialty | Applicable items |
|---|---|
| Alchemy | Alchemical items such as elixirs |
| Artistry | Fine art, including jewelery |
| Blacksmithing | Durable metal goods, including metal armor |

### Spell Identification
Arcana, Religion, Nature\
Free action\
You understand magic better than most and can quickly determine what spells are being cast. When a creature performs a Fighting move, Flourish, or Talent with the Spell trait, you can use this Free action to attempt a DC 15 Intelligence(Arcana) check to determine the name and effects of the spell. If the spell has a divine or primal origin, you can attempt an Intelligence(Religion) or Intelligence(Nature) check instead, respectively. 

### Student of the Canon
Religion\
Constant\
You’ve researched many faiths enough to recognize notions about them that are unlikely to be true. If you roll a critical failure at a Religion check to Decipher Writing of a religious nature or to Recall Knowledge about  faiths, you get a failure instead. When attempting to Recall Knowledge about the tenets of your own faith, if you roll a failure, you get a success instead, and if you roll a success, you get a critical success instead. 

You must be a follower of a specific religion to choose this Talent.

### Subtle Theft
Sleight of hand\
Constant\
When you successfully Steal something, observers (creatures other than the creature you stole from) take a –3 circumstance penalty to their Perception DCs to detect your theft. Additionally, if you first Create a Diversion using Deception, taking a single Palm an Object or Steal action doesn’t end your undetected condition.

### Swift Sneak
Stealth\
Constant\
You can move your full Speed when you Sneak. You can use Swift Sneak while Burrowing, Climbing, Flying, or Swimming instead of Striding if you have the corresponding movement type.

### Swimmer
You gain a swimming speed of 6m.

Somthing strange has happended to your mind. You can communicate telepatically with any creature within 20m of you that you share a language with.

### Wary Disarmamant
Sleight of hand\
Constant\

### Woodland Stride
Nature\
Constant\
You can always find a path, almost as if foliage parted before you. You ignore any difficult terrain caused by natural plants and fungi, such as bushes, vines, and undergrowth.
