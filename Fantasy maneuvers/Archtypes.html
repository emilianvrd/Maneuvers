            <p>Across the world, students in martial academies practice with their blades to master one-on-one combat.
                The libraries of such schools hold deep troves of information detailing hundreds of combat techniques,
                battle stances, and honorable rules of engagement. Those who gain admission to such schools might train
                in formalized duels—and that&#39;s certainly the more genteel route to take. However, others assert that
                there&#39;s no better place to try out dueling techniques than in the life-and-death struggles common to
                an adventurer&#39;s life.</p>

            <h3 id="familiar-master">Familiar master</h3>
            <p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog
                (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or
                weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen
                form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>
            <p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls its own
                initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
            </p>
            <p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears if
                you spend 1 hour and 10gp to resummon it. </p>
            <p>As an action, you can temporarily dismiss your familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can
                dismiss it forever. As an action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any
                unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points or disappears into
                the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>
            <p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally,
                as an action, you can see through your familiar’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your
                next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this time, you are
                deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>
            <p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had
                cast the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver
                the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack modifier for the
                roll.</p>

            <p>You know how to use the earth to crush your foes. </p>

                    must
                    make a Might saving throw against your Might or Dexterity DC or they lose the action or actions used
                    to
                    cast the Spell.</p>
