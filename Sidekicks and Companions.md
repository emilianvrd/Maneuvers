# Sidekicks and Companions
Often, a character gains an ability that references an Animal Companion, a Construct Companion, or a Humanoid Companion. These are creatures directly under one PC's control and essentially act as a part of their character. A Sidekick is an NPC who has chosen to be with the party. The Sidekick will often be administered by a player, but it is not a part of their character and the Sidekick is free to leave the party at any point.

## Companions

## Sidekicks
When creating a sidekick follow the same steps as when creating a normal character except the sidecick learns only two Fighting moves and only a single Flourish and a Skill feat. The Flourish must be one that can normally used three times per day, but the Sidekick can use the Flourish once per encounter instead. 

Instead of leveling up a Sidekick as a PC, they gain the following benefits when they go up a level:\
Increase their HP by 2\
At level 4 and 7, they gain a +1 bonus to AC, attacks, skills, and damage rolls and at 5th level they gain another archetype.\
