### Empower
When performing a Flourish, a you can choose to Empower it. The flourish you want to Empower must be one that can be used 3 times per day and you must have all uses left. When you empower an ability, you gain a +2 bonus to hit and the Flourish deals double the damage it normally deals. A flourish also adds special abilities when Empowered.

## Spells 
Performing an action with the Spell trait is called casting a spell. The first time you select an ability with the Spell trait, choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. The chosen ability becomes your spellcasting ability and is often referenced in Fighting Moves and Flourishes. Your spell save DC is 10 + your spellcasting ability and your attack modifier is 4+your spellcasting ability.

## Hands
A character often need to use their hands. For the most part, the GM will use common sense to determine if a character needs their hands and how many. A character always needs a free hand to wield a weapon or to cast a spell. If the character uses both hands to wield a single Melee weapon, increase the damage die by two steps (1d4->1d8, 1d6->1d10, and so on). As normal for increasing damage dice, if increasing the die size by two steps isn't possible, you gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each step that isn't possible, instead. If a character performs a fighting maneuver with the Spell trait while both their hands are free, or they are wielding a staff or other spellcasting foci in one hand and the other hand is free, increase the damage die by two steps aswell.
