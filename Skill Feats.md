# Skill Feats
Skill feats are an intergral part of your character. They determine much of what you can do during exploration and social interaction.

## 1st
### Alarm
Spell\
10 minutes\
You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a tiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping. An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within 60 feet.

### Animal friendship
Beasts, Nature, Spell\
2 actions\
This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within 12m of you. It must see and hear you. If the beast’s Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

### Animal messenger
Beasts, Nature, Spell\
10 minutes\
By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before 24 hours have passed, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.

### Assurance
Skill\
Constant\
You never fail when doing what you are best at. Choose one Skill your are Trained in. When you would make an ability check using that skill, you can instead choose to gain a result of 10 + the relevant Ability Modifier. Circumstance, status, and item bonuses and penalties applies as normal.

### Cat fall
Acrobatics\
1 reaction\
You have learned special techniques to fall without hurting yourself. When you would take damage from a fall, you can use your reaction to treat the fall as 20m shorter.

### Comprehend languages
Spell\
10 minutes\
For 10 minute, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

### Dancing lights
Light, Spell\
Quick action\
You create four dancing lights at different points within 20m of you. Each dancing light sheds bright light for up to 6m and dim light for an additional 6m. As a Quick action on subsequent turns, you can move each of the lights to a different posisition within 20m of you. If at any point one of the lights are more than 20m from you, that light fades.

### Detect magic
Divination, Spell\
2 actions\
For 1 minute, you sense the presence of magic within 10m of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Detect poison and disease
Divination, Spell\
1 hour\
For 1 minute, you can sense the presence and location of poisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 10m of you. You also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each case.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

### Detect thoughts
Divination, Spell\
10 minutes\
A creature within 10m of you must make Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you immediatly learns its surface thoughts(what it is thinking the most about at the moment).

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

### Disguise self
Illusion, Spell\
2 actions\
You make yourself – including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person – look different until 1 hour have passed or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem up to 30cm shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair. To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and m   |ust succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. 

You can cast this spell twice per day.

### Druidcraft
Nature, Plant\
1 action\
Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

* You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb  for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
* You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
* You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect  must fit in a 5-foot cube.
* You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
* You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the ground, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.
* You cause the area to become owergrown, making it to difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. 

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell. 

### Linguist
Language\
Constant\
You learn 3 languages of your choice. In addition,you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Society checks to decipher a text.

### Mage hand
Spell\
1 action\
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.
The hand lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 12m away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 1m each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 5kg. 

### Mending
Construction\
1 minute
You repairs a single break or tear in an object within 4m of you, such as broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloack, or a leaking wineskin.
As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

You can physically repair a magic item or construct with this ability, but doing so will not restore magic to such an object. 

### Message
Spell\
1 action\
You point your finger toward a creature within 30m and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

### Minor illusion
Illusion, Spell\
2 actions\
You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the 1 minute. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than 1m cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

You can have no more than one illusion created by this spell at a time.

### Prestidigation
Spell\
1 action\
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

* You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
* You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.
* You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.
* You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

* You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have enough force to cause damage.
* You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.
* You freeze the water, provided that there are no crea- tures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.
