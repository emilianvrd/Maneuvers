## Quick Jump
Movement\
1 action\
You can use High Jump and Long Jump as a single action instead of 2 actions. If you do, you don’t perform the initial Stride (nor do you fail if you don’t Stride 10 feet). In addition, you increase the vertical distance you move when you High Jump by 2m and the horizontal distance you move when you Long Jump by 4m.
