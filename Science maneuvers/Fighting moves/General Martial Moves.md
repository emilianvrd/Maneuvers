If you hit and deal damage, the target takes one of the following effects, based on the body part you targeted. The GM should use the stated effects as a guideline when attacking creatures with stranger anatomy—for instance, applying the “arms” effect to a creature's tentacles if those are what the creature uses to attack.
* **Arms** The target is enfeebled 2 until the end of your next turn. On a critical hit, it's also enfeebled 1 for 1 minute.
