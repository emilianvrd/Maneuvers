# Technological moves

## Acidic burst
Acid, Technological\
2 actions\
You throw a container filled with corroding acid at a point within 20m of you. Make a Gadget attack against every creature within 2m of that point to deal 2d8 Acid damage and 2d8 Persistent Acid damage on a Success.

If you have both hands free, or you are wielding Tools in one hand and the other hand is free while performing this Fighting move, increase the damage of the initial Acid damage to 2d10, but not the persistent Acid damage.

At 7th level and again at 15th level, you roll an additional die for both the intial and the Persistent Acid damage.

You quickly create and throw a small grenade. Make a Gadget attack against a target within 20m of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Bludgeoning damage and 1d8 Fire damage. The target and each creature and unattended object within 4m of it also takes 2 Fire damage on a Success. This damage increases by 2 at 7th level and again at 15th level. You roll an additional die of Fire damage when you reach those levels as well.

If you have both hands free when making this Strike, increase the damage to 1d10 Bludgeoning damage and 1d10 Fire damage.
