# Gunnery Moves

## Bullet split
Ranged\
1 action\
You carefully align your weapon with the edge of your blade, splitting the projectile in two as you fire to attack two different targets. As a single action, make two Strikes against two separate targets. You must be wielding both a ranged and a melee weapon and the targets must be adjacent to each other and within your weapon's maximum range. Each of these attacks takes a –2 penalty to the attack roll.

## Cover Fire
Ranged\
1 action\
You lay down suppressive fire to protect allies by forcing foes to take cover from your wild attacks. Make a Ranged Strike; the target must decide before you roll your attack whether it will duck out of the way. If the target ducks, it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against your attack, or a +4 circumstance bonus to AC if it has cover. It also takes a –2 circumstance penalty to ranged attack rolls until the end of its next turn. If the target chooses not to duck, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll for that Strike.

## Debilitating Shot
Ranged\
2 actions\
Aiming for a weak point, you impede your foe with a precise shot. Make a ranged weapon Strike. If it hits and deals damage, the target is slowed 1 until the end of its next turn.

## Deflecting shot
Ranged\
Reaction\
You're always ready to take a quick shot to deflect a weapon or distract a foe enough to render them off target. As a reaction when an ally within the first range increment of a ranged weapon you are wielding is hit by an attack, and you can see the attacker, you can give the ally a +2 circumstance bonus to their AC against the triggering attack. You use this reaction after the result of the attack roll is revealed, so you know whether the +2 will make a sufficient difference.

## Exploding Shot
Ranged\
1 action\
You shoot an exploding projectile. Make a single Strike and compare the result to the Dexterity defense DC of each creature in a 4m radius sphere centered on a point within the first range increment of a ranged weapon you are wielding. The creature takes damage as if hit by a Strike with the ranged weapon.

## Point-Blank Shot
Ranged\
1 action\
You take aim to pick off nearby enemies quickly. Make a Ranged Strike against a target within your weapon's first range increment. On a hit, you gain a +2 bonus to damage and the attack ignores any damage resistance the opponent may have.

## Sniper's Aim
Ranged\
2 actions\
You focus on a weak spot to make your attack particularly deadly. Make a ranged Strike. If you hit, you get a critical success instead.

## Twin Shot Knockdown
Ranged\
2 actions\
You fire at an enemy while targeting a part of its anatomy that will disrupt its balance. Make two ranged Strikes against the same target, one with each of the required weapons. If both Strikes are successful, the target is also knocked prone.
