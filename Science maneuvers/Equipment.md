# Equipment
To make your mark on the world, you’ll need to have the right equipment, including armor, weapons, and other gear. This chapter presents the various equipment that you can purchase during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities and trade ports.

Your character starts out with 1500 credits (c) to spend on any common items from this chapter. Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased only if you have special access from abilities you selected during character creation or your GM gives you permission to purchase them.

Once you’ve purchased your starting items, there are three main ways to gain new items and equipment: you can find them during an adventure, make them using the Crafting skill, or purchase them.

## Armor
Armor increases your character’s defenses, but some medium or heavy armor can hamper movement. If you want to increase your character’s defense beyond the protection your armor provides, they can use a shield. Armor protects your character only while they’re wearing it.

### Armor Rules

#### Armor without proficiency
If you are wearing armor you are not proficienct in, you take a -4m penalty to speed and you halve the armor's item bonus to Dexterity saving throws (round down as normal).

#### Donning and doffing armor
Getting in and out of armor is time consuming—so make sure you’re wearing it when you need it! Donning and removing armor are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to don light armor, 5 minutes to don medium or heavy armor, and 1 minute to remove or doff any armor.

#### Category
The armor’s category (unarmored, light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor) indicate which proficiency is used to determine if you are proficient in your armor or not.

#### Dexterity Defense Roll bonus
This number is the item bonus you add to your Dexterity Defense Rolls.

#### Dexterity modifier cap (Dex cap)
This number is the maximum amount of your Dexterity modifier that can apply to your Dexterity saving throws while you are wearing a given suit of armor. For example, if you have a Dexterity modifier of +4 and you are wearing a suit of half plate, you apply only a +1 bonus from your Dexterity modifier to your Dexterity saving throws while wearing that armor.

#### Check penalty
While wearing your armor, you take this penalty to Might- and Dexterity-based skill checks, except for those that have the attack trait. If you meet the armor’s Might threshold (see the Might column above), you don’t take this penalty.

#### Speed penalty
While wearing a suit of armor, you take the penalty listed in this entry to your speed, as well as to any other movement types you have, such as a climb speed or swim speed, to a minimum speed of 5 feet. If you meet the armor’s Might threshold (see the Might column above), you reduce the penalty by 2m.

#### Group
Each type of armor belongs to an armor group, which classifies it with similar types of armor. Some abilities reference armor groups, but they are also used to determine the hit points of the armor. Armor rarely takes damage, but a few abilities can damage armor.

| Name | Hardness | HP |
|---|---|---|
| Carbon | 4 | 16 |
| Composite | 8 | 32 |
| Durasteel | 16 | 72 |
| Ceramete | 18 | 72 |
| Adamantine | 20 | 80 |

In additon, the armor's weight doesn't count towards your carrying capacity. Powered armor typically also has no or a lower speed penalty than comparable non-powered armor. 

**Sneak** This armor is used by spies and assasins across the galaxy. You gain a +1 Item bonus to Stealth checks while wearing this armor.

## Shields
While many are content with the defense their armor gives them, others supplement themselves with a shield. Shields give you a circumstance bonus to Dexterity saving throws and can also be used to make Brawling attacks

### Shield Rules

#### Donning or doffing shield
Unless stated otherwise, donning og doffing a shield takes 1 Interact action.

#### Shields as weapons
If you make a Brawling attack with a shield it deals the damage listed in the damage column. A trait in the Traits column not listed in under Shield Traits is described in the Weapon Traits section and applies to Brawling attacks made using the shield. All shields are Martial weapons in the Shield weapon group.

#### Speed penalty
Some shields are particularly heavy or otherwise inhibit movement and thereby gives a speed penalty to anyone who is wielding it. As normal, this penalty applies to all the reciever's speeds.

#### Hit points
Shields have hit points and hardness based on their weight. While they are made with different materials, all shields are designed to be as sturdy as possible and the materials therefore matters little. Each shield has Hardness equal to their weight in kilos, and hit points equal to five times their weight.

**Heather Shield** These classic shields are among the most commonly used due to their versatile nature and ease of equipping.

**Hook Shield** A round wooden shield with the edges covered in steel from which a large hook protrudes. The hook is positioned over the hand and allows the shield to be used for various combat maneuvers, such as grappling and disarming.

### Shield Traits
**Cumbersome**
Wielding a Cumbersome shield is no small task. A creature holding a Cumbersome shield is Immobilized unless its Might score equals or is higher than the bonus listed.

**Dart-thrower**
A shield with this trait has an integrated dart thrower and can be used to make ranged Strikes with the dart thrower. See the Weapon section below.

**Deflect**
This shield is paricularly adapted at deflecting a certain type of damage. Whenever the wielder takes damage of the the type listed, reduce the damage by the number listed.

**Dual**
Shields with the Dual trait are meant to be paired. If you are holding a shield with the Dual trait in each hand, the circumstance bonus from the shield increases to the listed amount.

**Freestanding**
A shield with the Freestanding trait is practically a mobile wall. As an Interact action while wielding the shield, it can be doffed and positioned on the ground in an unoccupied adjacent 2m³ square. While posistioned in this way, it gived its circumstance bonus to Dexterity saving throws to any creatures standing adjacent to it who is targeted by an attack that would pass through the square the shield is positioned in. To determine whether an attack would pass through the square the shield is positioned in, draw a straight line from the center of the attacker to the center of the target. If it passes through the square the shield in positioned in, the circumstance bonus applies. If the line only passes through the edge of the shield, the GM may rule only half the circumstance bonus applies.

**Harnessed**
This shield type features a special brace or opening designed to hold lances or other jousting weapons. Jousters often use these shields as a backup in narrow passages and other places where they're unable to ride a mount. You can use the Interact action to lock a weapon with the jousting trait in place in the shield, enabling you to use two hands to wield the shield and weapon simultaneously. If you're not wielding the combined unit with both hands, you can use neither the weapon nor the shield.

While you are wielding the shield, you can gain the jousting benefit of a weapon as if you were mounted. Because a significant portion of the weapon needs to be braced behind the shield, the weapon's reach is reduced by 5 feet if it is greater than 5 feet.

**Quick equip**
This type of shield is designed to be donned and doffed quickly. You can don or doff this shield as a Free action.

**Raise**
You can use an action to focus on defending with the shield, increasing the circumstance bonus to Dexterity saving throws to the listed amount.

**Versatile defense**
Shields with the Versatile defense trait can be easily positioned in the gaps of any other protection you may have. If you a wielding a shield with this trait and you would gain a circumstance bonus to Dexterity saving throws from another source, you increase the circumstance bonus to Dexterity saving throws from the shield by 1 while you would gain this circumstance bonus. This increase only applies once and the circumstance bonus provided by the shield can therefore never increase by more than 1 due to this feature.

### Traits

**Backstabber** When you hit an off-guard creature, this weapon deals 1 precision damage in addition to its normal damage. The precision damage increases to 2 if the weapon has a +3 accuracy upgrade.

**Backswing** You can use the momentum from a missed attack with this weapon to lead into your next attack. After missing with this weapon on your turn, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your next attack with this weapon before the end of your turn.

**Concussive** These weapons smash as much as puncture. When determining a creature's resistance or immunity to damage from this weapon, use the weaker of the target's resistance or immunity to piercing or to bludgeoning. For instance, if the creature were immune to piercing and had no resistance or immunity to bludgeoning damage, it would take full damage from a concussive weapon. Resistance or immunity to all physical damage, or all damage, applies as normal.

**Concealable** This weapon is designed to be inconspicuous or easily concealed. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to hide or conceal a weapon with this trait.

**Deadly** On a critical hit, the weapon adds a weapon damage die of the listed size. Roll this after doubling the weapon’s damage. This increases to two dice if the weapon has a greater striking upgrade and three dice if the weapon has a major striking upgrade. For instance, an Electrolance with a greater striking upgrade deals 2d8 extra piercing damage on a critical hit. An ability that changes the size of the weapon’s normal damage dice doesn’t change the size of its deadly die.

**Disarm** You can use this weapon to Disarm with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls (if any) as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Disarm using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure. On a critical success, you still need a free hand if you want to take the item.

**Fatal** The fatal trait includes a die size. On a critical hit, the weapon’s damage die increases to that die size instead of the normal die size, and the weapon adds one additional damage die of the listed size.

**Finesse** You can use your modifier to Gunnery attacks instead of your modifier with Gunnery attacks when you use this weapon. You still otherwise follow all rules for making a Brawling attack and still add your Might to the damage.

**Forceful** This weapon becomes more dangerous as you build momentum. When you attack with it more than once on your turn, the second attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to the number of weapon damage dice, and each later attack gains a circumstance bonus to damage equal to double the number of damage dice.

**Free-Hand** This weapon doesn’t take up your hand, usually because it is built into your armor. A free-hand weapon can’t be Disarmed. You can use the hand covered by your free-hand weapon to wield other items, perform manipulate actions, and so on. You can’t attack with a free-hand weapon if you’re wielding anything in that hand or otherwise using that hand. When you’re not wielding anything and not otherwise using the hand, you can use abilities that require you to have a hand free as well as those that require you to be wielding a weapon in that hand. Each of your hands can have only one free-hand weapon on it.

**Grapple** You can use this weapon to Grapple with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Grapple using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Jousting** The weapon is suited for mounted combat with a harness or similar means. When mounted, if you moved at least 4m on the action before your attack, add a circumstance bonus to damage for that attack equal to the number of damage dice for the weapon. In addition, while mounted, you can wield the weapon in one hand, changing the damage die to the listed value. As a part of your action to Mount a creature, you can switch your grip on a jousting weapon to one-handed. After that, changing your grip takes the same actions described on Carrying Items. If you dismount while wielding a jousting weapon one-handed, you can switch to using two hands as part of that action if you have a hand free at that point. If not, you’ll still be holding the weapon in one hand, but not wielding it.

**Light** If you make two or more Brawling or Gunnery attack with one or more weapons with the Light trait, you can use a Free action to make another Brawling or Gunnery attack with a weapon with the Light trait you have previously attacked with.

**Line** This weapon damages everything up to its target. Each creature between you and the target when you make a Gunnery attack with this weapon takes 2 damage per weapon damage die of the same type as the weapon deals. If the weapon deals more than one type of damage, you choose which of those damage types each one takes. 

**Mighty** This weapon has significant recoil, requieres significant strength to draw, or is otherwise heavy or unwieldy. Attacks with this weapon deal an additional point of damage per weapon damage die, but you take a -2 Circumstance penalty to Strikes with this weapon unless your Might is +2 or higher. Your GM might waive this penalty if a weapon with significant recoil is mounted on a tripod or similar stabilizing feature.

**Nonlethal** Attacks with this weapon are nonlethal, and are used to knock creatures unconscious instead of kill them. You can use a nonlethal weapon to make a lethal attack with a –2 circumstance penalty.

**Parry** This weapon can be used defensively to block attacks. While wielding this weapon, if your proficiency with it is trained or better, you can spend a single action to position your weapon defensively, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus to Dexterity Defense Rolls until the start of your next turn.

**Ranged Trip** The weapon can be used to Trip with the Athletics skill within the weapon’s first range increment. The skill check takes a –2 circumstance penalty. You can add the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as a bonus to the check. A ranged trip weapon doesn’t deal any damage when used to Trip. These weapons are usually thrown.

**Rapid-fire** These weapons fire numerous shots with short delay. If you make two Gunnery attacks with a weapon with this trait, you can make another Gunnery attack as a Free action.

**Razing** Razing weapons are particularly good at damaging objects, structures, and vehicles. Whenever you deal damage to an object (including shields), structure, or vehicle with a razing weapon, the object takes an amount of additional damage equal to double the number of weapon damage dice. 

**Reach** This weapon can be used to attack enemies up to 4 meters away instead of only adjacent enemies. For creatures with reach, the weapon increases their reach by 2m.

**Scatter** This weapon fires a cluster of pellets in a wide spray or otherwise damages a large area. Scatter always has an area listed with it, indicating the radius of the spray. On a hit, the primary target of attacks with a scatter weapon take the listed damage, and the target and all other creatures within the listed radius around it take 1 point of splash damage per weapon damage die.

**Shove** You can use this weapon to Shove with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Shove using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Stun** When you attack with this weapon, you can choose whether the damage is Nonlethal or not. You can choose separately for each attack.

**Sweep** This weapon makes wide swinging attacks. When you attack with this weapon, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your attack roll if you already attempted to attack a different target this turn using this weapon.

**Thrown** You can throw this weapon as a Gunnery attack; it is a ranged weapon when thrown. You add your Might modifier to damage as you would for a Brawling weapon. When this trait appears on a Brawling weapon, it also includes the range increment. Gunnery weapons with this trait use the range increment in the weapon’s Range entry.

**Trip** You can use this weapon to Trip with the Athletics skill even if you don’t have a free hand. This uses the weapon’s reach (if different from your own) and adds the weapon’s item bonus to attack rolls as an item bonus to the Athletics check. If you critically fail a check to Trip using the weapon, you can drop the weapon to take the effects of a failure instead of a critical failure.

**Twin** These weapons are used as a pair. When you attack with a twin weapon, you add a circumstance bonus to the damage roll equal to the weapon’s number of damage dice if you have previously attacked with a different weapon of the same type this turn. The weapons must be of the same type, but they don’t need to have the same runes.

**Two-Hand** This weapon can be wielded with two hands to change its weapon damage die to the indicated value. This change applies to all the weapon’s damage dice.

**Unarmed** An unarmed attack uses your body rather than a manufactured weapon. An unarmed attack isn’t a weapon, though has a weapon group and might have weapon traits. An unarmed attack can’t be Disarmed. It also doesn’t take up a hand, though a fist or other grasping appendage generally works like a free-hand weapon.

**Versatile** A versatile weapon can be used to deal a different type of damage than its listed type. This trait indicates the alternate damage type. For instance, a piercing weapon with versatile S can deal piercing or slashing damage. You choose the damage type each time you attack.

**Volley** This ranged weapon is less effective at close distances. Your attacks against targets that are at a distance within the range listed take a –2 penalty.

### Critical Effects
Each weapon adds a different additional effect on a critical hit, in addition to doubling the damage as normal. This is called a critical effect. The exact effect depends on which weapon group your weapon belongs to, as listed below. You can always decide not to add the critical effect of your weapon.

#### Corrosive
The target's wielded items and armor takes damage as if hit by the attack.

#### Electric
The electricity jolts from one target to another. Choose a creature or object adjacent to the target you hit. If its Dexterity Defense DC is lower than your attack roll result for the critical hit, you deal damage to that creature equal to the result of the weapon damage die you rolled (including extra dice for its Striking upgrades, if any). This amount isn't doubled, and no bonuses or other additional dice apply to this damage.

#### Flame
The target catches fire. It takes 1d6 persisitent Heat damage. If the weapon has a Greater Striking upgrade, the target takes 2d6 persistent damage instead.

#### Freezing
The target takes a -4m Circumstance penalty to its speed until the end of its next turn.

#### Kinetic
The target is knocked prone. 

#### Laser
You shoot the target in its eye, it becomes Dazzled until the end of its next turn.

#### Plasma
The area in a 2m emenation around the target becomes superheated. Each creature that starts its turn in the area takes 1d4 Heat damage. If the weapon has a Greater Striking upgrade, a creature takes 2d4 Heat damage instead.

#### Roaring
The target is Deafened until the end of its next turn. 

#### Toxic
The weapon sickends its target. It becomes Sickened 1 until the end of its next turn or until it spends an action removing the condition (no check requiered).

#### Trenchant
The target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage. If the weapon has a Greater Striking upgrade, the target takes 2d6 persistent damage instead.
